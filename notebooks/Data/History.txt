The UN Convention against Torture and Other Cruel and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment in 1987 unequivocally banned the use of torture. Nevertheless torture still occurs, even in the 130 countries that ratified the agreement.There is a great deal of controversy about what constitutes torture and some claim that it is justified in special situations like the War on Terror.This course will examine the goals and methods of torture through history, as it moved from a focus of inflicting pain to the use of psychological torture and sensory deprivation. We will explore how to study pain in history - does pain exist as an entity; unravel the changing relationships between the state, law, and torture; look at the torturers themselves - who they are, how they learn the techniques, and the effects on them. We will also consider what it says about us when we pursue "enhanced" quasi-torture interrogation techniques.HIST 1750Disasters in History(3)Disasters have taken many forms in human history, from earthquakes, fires, tsunamis and hurricanes to famine and epidemic disease. Nor should we forget manmade tragedies such as the terrorist attacks on 9/11 or the devastation produced by a combination of human and technological failures, such as the explosions at Chernobyl and Bhopal or the more recent BP oil spill just off of our own coast. Disasters are an important focus for historical inquiry for quite varied reasons. This is a unique course. It will be team-taught by 12 professors. Each professor will teach a 1-week unit on a historical disaster related to their area of specialization. In addition to an excellent learning experience, you will get to sample the teaching of more than half of the faculty members in the History Department.HIST 1760Eating & Drinking in History(3)Eating and Drinking are part of our everyday lives and experiences, and in that respect, these processes can seem natural rather than historical. However, if we stop and think about it, the politics, economics, and culture of food production and consumption have shaped communities and cultures in specific, and often divergent, ways.  In this course, we will take the overarching rubric of eating and drinking to explore the multiple ways in which studying food can illuminate our understanding of the past.  This course will include units on food, war, and hunger; commodity chains and trade; cultural relationships with alcohol; and labor and food production in the pre-industrial, industrial and post-industrial era. This is a team taught class taught by the History faculty.  Each professor will teach a 1-week unit on eating and drinking related to their area of specialization.HIST 1910Special Topics(3)Courses offered by visiting professors or permanent faculty.

We will explore questions of narrative form, visual and aural evidence, expertise and authority, and the ethics of representation. Collaboration will also be a central theme of this course since students will have to work together to determine their research subject, carry out research, shoot video, and edit together the final cut.HIST 3230Art and Craft of History(3)Introduction to researching and writing history.  We will develop these skills by studying scholars' investigations of the past, conducting archived research, and writing original essays.HIST 3240Public History Lab: Exhibits(3)Most students have visited a historical museum and/or exhibit at some point, perhaps on a school field trip or a family trip.  However, what goes into making an exhibit?  What are the politics involved?  Who decides what is included and what is not? And what is at stake in these decisions?HIST 3890Service Learning(0-1)Students complete a service activity in the community in conjunction with the content of a three-credit co-requisite course.

The topics include an introduction to the main features of the these two pre-industrial macro-economies, and then a series of topics that are of interest to both students of history and business majors.  Students will also gain knowledge of the sources and historical methods for the study of these economies, many of which differ from those of the modern era. Stress is on analysis and writing, and so the ability of a student to assimilate and synthesize data into coherent essays.HIST 4560Internship and Independent Study(1-3)Students will complete a 60-70 hour internship with a community partner.
