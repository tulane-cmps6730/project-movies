Overall an overrated scorer and defender.

Has no bag.

Terrible transition player.

No post game.

Inflated stats.

Mediocre 73% ft shooting.

Makes his teammates worse.

Choker.

Coach killer.

Overrated and terrible leader.

Team hopper.

Weak mentality.

Played in one of the weakest conferences ever. 

#1 in turnovers.

Will be #1 in missed shots by the end of his career.

His intangibles are terrible. 
-Going behind teammates backs, lying, EPO‚Äôs, etc. He doesn‚Äôt even have respect for his peers.
-He missed Kobe‚Äôs statue memorial but had time to go to the Super Bowl then had time to dm and get freaky with a woman by the name of Oshun Gurerea around all star break (allegedly). 
(He liked a picture of her that said a boy was in her dms calling her pretty, when ppl saw that lebron liked the pic, lebron unliked it, Oshun turned her account to private for a bit, while lebron was nowhere to be found during this time)
-He missed dwades hall of fame ceremony but had enough time to go to a party with Draymond. 
-Quit the 2024 all star game when he knew he wasn‚Äôt gonna get the mvp after he was jacking up shots (scored only 8 points, 40%fg, 0-3 from 3, kinda reminds me of 2011). 
-Lied and said he‚Äôs uncomfortable with praise, when:
-He build a museum for himself 
-made his wife call him the goat
-bring goats to one of his party to symbolize his ‚Äúgoatness‚Äù
-Literally called himself the goat in multiple occasions 
-Has klutch sports plants to praise him in the media 
-Demanded respect after winning the bubble title
-Has a history of posting/doing something to take away attention from other people, such as the time when he was losing the series vs the nuggets &amp; when Steph won a championship in golf, he decided to tease his retirement.
-Always claims to ‚Äúcall‚Äù something before something happens 
And more 
-He constantly demands respect instead of earning it.
Pathetic. 

Tried to go to Gsw.
Tried to get kd, kawhi, pg, etc.
Formed the heat superteam to stop Kobe, dwades words not mines.

Ty lue had to tell this man to play harder in 2016. This shows that lebron doesn‚Äôt give it his all, especially in the big moments.

Fake longevity. If you don‚Äôt play defense, score on weak defenses, don‚Äôt even play 75% of the season, and take the juice (allegedly), of course you‚Äôd be able to play for 20+ years and stat pad.

His fans claim he‚Äôs a goat level defender even though he has less all defensive teams than Chris Paul and was only able to be effective on defense via help defense.

Dwade said that him and lebron teamed up in order to stop Kobe. Bron is jealous of those who are greater and can‚Äôt win without cheating the game. None of his championships have value. 

Dwade revealed that the heat was trying to get Cp3 to the heat around 2012. Lebron was trying to get a super duper team. The only thing that stopped this was a disagreement on who‚Äôd be wearing the #3. Pathetic.

Overrated clutch ability. Most of his clutch shots came without being contested.
Shoots 38% in the clutch in the playoffs and 27% in the clutch in the finals. Swept 3 times in 3 separate decades. Lost 6 out of his 10 finals appearances. Choked in multiple years statistically. Only won when he had a superteam.
Garbage.
When we look at one of (if not the best of) lebron‚Äôs best playoff runs (2016), in the clutch, lebron had 5 points, from 2-9 fgs, while kyrie had 8 points off of 3-6 fgs. And then kyrie hit the game winning shot. 
In one of, if not THE best performances of lebron‚Äôs, he was getting outperformed in the clutch by a ‚Äúrobin.‚Äù 

Needed to get his agent Rich Paul to rig a trade for Ad. Ad signed with Paul before going to the lakers. Ad wasn‚Äôt supposed to be asking for trades at the time, also, he wasn‚Äôt accepting any other trade other than the lakers. And yet no one batted an eye.

Claims he‚Äôs not comfortable with praise and yet he has ‚Äúthe chosen one‚Äù tattooed on his back, ‚Äúwears a crown‚Äù on his head and calls himself the KING and the GOAT. Yea ok 

Overrated longevity. Puts low effort on defense and transition, allowing him more energy.
Doesn‚Äôt need to work hard for his buckets.
Played in a weak conference.

Lebron uses PED‚Äôs (allegedly)

-He been on the juice since 2008 when he came into the league 40-Ibs heavier in just 3 months during the off-season. Gaining this much weight in a short amount of time is impossible for a basketball player whose constantly running and exercising everyday burning mayor calories.
The very next year in 2009, lebron had a tumor removed from his jaw which is a side effect from steroids, and that's why he won't cut his beard cause it'll show. You can Google this for yourself. One has to wonder, how much juicing did lebron consume to develop a tumor in just one year? 
-Every other player with his skills or athleticism has shown clear and rapid decline with age. Even greats like Jordan and Wilt, who are both more athletically gifted than lebron showed clear and rapid decline with age. But with lebron‚Ä¶
-Steroids have been known to either be the cause or already accelerate hair loss. Lebron has a WELL KNOWN problem with hair loss since around the first time he‚Äôs been suspected of using steroids (2009). 
-Tristan Thomson, a player who has played 
with lebron for  multiple years in Cleveland, and a player who is close to lebron, tested positive for using PED‚Äôs
-Chel Sonnen, a professional athlete who has used drugs, someone who has accurately called out other drug using athletes, said that lebron uses PED‚Äôs and they both get it from the same guy. Lebron did not respond to this nor file for defamation, even though he has responded to or made actions against smaller things beforehand.
-Specifically, lebron takes EPO‚Äôs. EPO‚Äôs are natural occurring hormones that stimulates bone marrow to produce more red blood cells, which substantially increases endurance levels. Also, HGH (the PED Thomson tested positive for) boosts muscle and bone growth to  promote recovery, and it‚Äôs hard to test for due to it only staying in the body for two days. Also, the nba only checks twice for these things per year.
-When he went back to Cleveland, lebron showed decline in athleticism and stamina. He was having knee problems and had lost 20-30lbs. During this time, the league was cracking down on PED use. Then, he decided to take an oddly timed vacation to Miami on December 30th. Balco was in Miami at the time. The Cavs were 5th in the conference at the time and in the 8 games before his vacation, lebron averaged 24.4pt / 4.8 rb/ 7.8ast / 48%fg. When lebron returned, he mysteriously returned to his athletic form of his earlier years. He gained 20lbs of muscle over ONE weekend AND his knee problems disappeared. In the 8 games following his return, he averaged 30.5 ppg / 6.6rb / 6.4 ast / 51% fg. The Cavs then jumped to the 2nd seed in the east for the remainder of the season and went to the finals. Tristan Thomson was on this team as well.
-ALSO, around the time, he gained 7lbs in a playoff game (eastern conference finals on the heat) HOW? Wilt chamberlain would lose 10 pounds a game in his prime, and lebron‚Äôs out there GAINING pounds in a game where you burn 3000 cal? Especially a PLAYOFF game. Reports show that there was multiple heat teammates who witnessed him on a scale showing his weight before and after the game as well.
-In an official Federal PED investigation, lebron James close associates Ernest Mims-Buisness Manager and David Alexander-trainer (former trainer of lebron and his  wife), along with multiple MLB players like Alex Rodriguez, Ryan Brawn  and Nelson Cruz, have been named in unredacted Federal Documents relating to the biogenesis scandal that happened in the early 2010‚Äôs, right around where some of the first accusations of lebron using steroids occurred. Lebron and Mims when asked for an interview about the situation declined, even after the interviewer‚Äôs presented their probable reasons for asking for an interview. The media has a huge economic incentive to not reports on lebron. Anyone who‚Äôs talked about such things has been blackballed. 
Also, an annonymous woman who worked at the clinic involved in the scandal (which was ran by Tony Bosh) said that a client named MR PAUL (Lebron James‚Äôs agent and close friend at the time and till this day is named Rich PAUL) would pick up PED‚Äôs for a client with the initials ‚ÄúLJ‚Äù (Lebron James). 
-In February 2023, lebron feel and said he felt a pop. Following a diagnosis, it was reported that lebron toor a tendon in his foot. It was reported that the injury could potentially be season ending, and would take a month to recover from. But, lebron coincidentally recovered faster than anyone the doctors seen with that injury before, and came back a week  later. This is something lebron claimed the doctors had said. In his 20th season, in a season where he had high usage and wear and tear, he was able to perform a miracle‚Ä¶coincidentally. 
Also, Dennis Schroeder, teammate of lebron at the time said ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt say to much, but German doctors are great.‚Äù
-JimmyHighroller, a popular basketball YouTuber, who is an advent lebron fan, made a video years ago exposing damming evidence of lebron using PED‚Äôs. Then he randomly took the video down, something he never does, did, or has done since. Maybe someone told him to ‚Äúbe quiet‚Äù‚Ä¶
-Chris Paul, one of lebron‚Äôs close friends, the head of the players association, told the nba to stop testing for steroids. Why would he do this? Most likely to cover up what‚Äôs happening behind the scenes‚Ä¶
-A neuroscientist named Andrew Huberman, an associate professor of neurobiology at Stanford University school of Medicine, went on record during the Joe Rogan podcast with reports from an active NBA player who said something similar to the following in regards to steroids:‚Äúwell if you get injured, you can take up to 200 migs a week.‚Äù
This is considered a trd dose.
Lebron was active at this time.
-Lebron had surgery to remove growth in his jaw and since 2010 has grown a big beard.
Jaw fullness is a known symptom of steroid use and the beard is a perfect cover up for the surgery. 
-No other NBA player has been able to put up such stats while not facing much injury. He‚Äôs the only player to do that. 
-Lebron is a repeat liar. He claimed he never cheated the game, he claimed he didn‚Äôt know how to flop, every time you see him with a book it‚Äôs always on the 1st page, he doesn‚Äôt know the lyrics to songs but he tries to come off as a guy who actually listens to the songs, he flops, etc. The little things show us that lebron does not mind lying.
-The league has shown clear efforts to protect lebron‚Äôs image. Forcing him into the goat conversation, never mentioning his bad performances but always mentioning the bad performances of his teammates, never attacking an off the court story about lebron but always willing to do the same to lesser known players, promoting lebron over curry, even though curry has been the clear bigger draw when you look at jersey sales this past decade, ratings, love from fans and views. They turned the other cheek when lebron formed superteams but didn‚Äôt let a guy like Kobe get Chris Paul. Cheated the game for lebron, 2016 and 2023 for example. I can go on and on. The league has clearly shown that they want and will protect lebron from bad PR. Meaning that if something about lebron‚Äôs use of PED‚Äôs come up, they can and will shut that down. 
-Remember when Charles Barkley called him out for wanting another playmaker and he responded with airing out all of Barkley's personal mishaps? LeBron should keep that same energy with Chael Sonnen be this is a serious allegation. The longer LeBron stays silent, the more he incriminates himself
-Lebron‚Äôs trainer got caught with PED‚Äôs before but the quickly said that it was for lebron‚Äôs wife. Interesting. 
-Kevin Garnett said Lebron is ‚Äúon that balco, on that new juice‚Äù in an interview with Paul pierce, relating to why his son Bronny wouldn‚Äôt be able to get a bucket on him, even at an older age. Pierce didn‚Äôt fight the point. And you can‚Äôt say KG is a hater. This is the same dude that said Bron is ‚Äúat the TOP of the list‚Äù when referring to all time greats. And in the context of his quote, he was backing up lebron. 
Also, Balco in particular was a scandal involving the use of banned substances, performance enhancing drugs. The PED‚Äôs used in the scandal was called ‚Äúthe clear‚Äù, an undetectable steroid.
This scandal was backed by its founder, Victor Conte. 
Kg also said that the media and companies partnered with lebron are protecting him. 
And, this is only Kg‚Äôs FOURTH time of hinting at lebron using steroids. 
-The media/public is fine with accusing sports  players, such as Barry Bonds, for using drugs, while never failing a drug test. But when it comes to Bron, silence. It‚Äôs favoritism.

After the 2024 all star game, in an interview, lebron said that ‚Äúmost games (regular season) are are starting to look like that too.‚Äù
Referring to the all star game as soft and non competitive with little defense.
LEBRON JAMES HIMSELF HAS SAID THAT THE LEAGUE IS SOFT NOW. 
MEANING THAT THE COMPETITION TODAY ISNT AS GOOD AS BEFORE &amp; THAT MEANS THAT LEBRON IS ALSO SOFT 

I can‚Äôt make a claim that this is an absolute truth, but looking at the facts and circumstances of this situation, I personally believe that lebron is on the juice.

Pays the media to praise him (allegedly).

Constantly lies.

Not even top 10.

Overrated.

Lebron‚Äôs only good years 

Lebron has been cheating the game since 2009, so you can‚Äôt really count the years of 2009-present as true greatness.
From the juicing (allegedly) to him going behind the scenes as LeGM to him paying the media to help him, his career after this point can‚Äôt be respected. 

Let‚Äôs look at the years before lebron started to cheat the game (2003-04 to 2007-08)

Stats: 27ppg/7rpg/6apg/1.7spg/0.8bpg/3tpg/9.8fgm/21.16fga/46.5%fg/1.3 3ptm/4 3pta/32% 3pt/6.3 ftm/8.7 fta/73% ft/ 

Accolades (excluding the ROTY because he stole it from Melo): 2 bronze medals/1 gold medal/ECF championship/all rookie 1st team/4x all star/2x all nba 1st team/2x all nba 2nd team/2008 scoring champion/2x asg mvp/ 

Highlights: Got to the finals in 2007, scoring title in 2008, gold medal in 2008

Lowlights: Swept in 2007 (due to his poor play), two bronze medals on stacked team USA teams, missed the playoffs twice, destroyed in playoffs in 2005-06 and 2007-08

A player with only 5 decent years of play without cheating, having bad shooting splits, meltdowns, and being allowed to carry, travel, commit offensive fouls, flop, and facing weak defensive coverage as a player. And not making a single all defensive team. 

His chances of being a top 75 player with this resume is 70% MAX. And if we deduct points for how easy he had it for things such as his traveling and carrying being allowed, then in reality it‚Äôs 50%. Is this your king? An overblown role player?

And if I‚Äôm being generous and give him up until 2011, where more damning evidence truly came out, excluding the two MVPs he stole, he‚Äôd only have 2 more all stars and all NBAs, 2 all defensive teams, and two choking jobs in the playoffs of 09 and 10. He‚Äôd still be an overblown role player.

-ALSO, around the time, he gained 7lbs in a playoff game (eastern conference finals on the heat) HOW? Wilt chamberlain would lose 10 pounds a game in his prime, and lebron‚Äôs out there GAINING pounds in a game where you burn 3000 cal? Especially a PLAYOFF game. Reports show that there was multiple heat teammates who witnessed him on a scale showing his weight before and after the game as well.
-In an official Federal PED investigation, lebron James close associates Ernest Mims-Buisness Manager and David Alexander-trainer (former trainer of lebron and his  wife), along with multiple MLB players like Alex Rodriguez, Ryan Brawn  and Nelson Cruz, have been named in unredacted Federal Documents relating to the biogenesis scandal that happened in the early 2010‚Äôs, right around where some of the first accusations of lebron using steroids occurred. Lebron and Mims when asked for an interview about the situation declined, even after the interviewer‚Äôs presented their probable reasons for asking for an interview. The media has a huge economic incentive to not reports on lebron. Anyone who‚Äôs talked about such things has been blackballed. 
Also, an annonymous woman who worked at the clinic involved in the scandal (which was ran by Tony Bosh) said that a client named MR PAUL (Lebron James‚Äôs agent and close friend at the time and till this day is named Rich PAUL) would pick up PED‚Äôs for a client with the initials ‚ÄúLJ‚Äù (Lebron James). 
-In February 2023, lebron feel and said he felt a pop. Following a diagnosis, it was reported that lebron toor a tendon in his foot. It was reported that the injury could potentially be season ending, and would take a month to recover from. But, lebron coincidentally recovered faster than anyone the doctors seen with that injury before, and came back a week  later. This is something lebron claimed the doctors had said. In his 20th season, in a season where he had high usage and wear and tear, he was able to perform a miracle‚Ä¶coincidentally. 
Also, Dennis Schroeder, teammate of lebron at the time said ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt say to much, but German doctors are great.‚Äù
-JimmyHighroller, a popular basketball YouTuber, who is an advent lebron fan, made a video years ago exposing damming evidence of lebron using PED‚Äôs. Then he randomly took the video down, something he never does, did, or has done since. Maybe someone told him to ‚Äúbe quiet‚Äù‚Ä¶
-Chris Paul, one of lebron‚Äôs close friends, the head of the players association, told the nba to stop testing for steroids. Why would he do this? Most likely to cover up what‚Äôs happening behind the scenes‚Ä¶
-A neuroscientist named Andrew Huberman, an associate professor of neurobiology at Stanford University school of Medicine, went on record during the Joe Rogan podcast with reports from an active NBA player who said something similar to the following in regards to steroids:‚Äúwell if you get injured, you can take up to 200 migs a week.‚Äù
This is considered a trd dose.
Lebron was active at this time.
-Lebron had surgery to remove growth in his jaw and since 2010 has grown a big beard.
Jaw fullness is a known symptom of steroid use and the beard is a perfect cover up for the surgery. 
-No other NBA player has been able to put up such stats while not facing much injury. He‚Äôs the only player to do that. 
-Lebron is a repeat liar. He claimed he never cheated the game, he claimed he didn‚Äôt know how to flop, every time you see him with a book it‚Äôs always on the 1st page, he doesn‚Äôt know the lyrics to songs but he tries to come off as a guy who actually listens to the songs, he flops, etc. The little things show us that lebron does not mind lying.
-The league has shown clear efforts to protect lebron‚Äôs image. Forcing him into the goat conversation, never mentioning his bad performances but always mentioning the bad performances of his teammates, never attacking an off the court story about lebron but always willing to do the same to lesser known players, promoting lebron over curry, even though curry has been the clear bigger draw when you look at jersey sales this past decade, ratings, love from fans and views. They turned the other cheek when lebron formed superteams but didn‚Äôt let a guy like Kobe get Chris Paul. Cheated the game for lebron, 2016 and 2023 for example. I can go on and on. The league has clearly shown that they want and will protect lebron from bad PR. Meaning that if something about lebron‚Äôs use of PED‚Äôs come up, they can and will shut that down. 
-Remember when Charles Barkley called him out for wanting another playmaker and he responded with airing out all of Barkley's personal mishaps? LeBron should keep that same energy with Chael Sonnen be this is a serious allegation. The longer LeBron stays silent, the more he incriminates himself
-Lebron‚Äôs trainer got caught with PED‚Äôs before but the quickly said that it was for lebron‚Äôs wife. Interesting. 
-Kevin Garnett said Lebron is ‚Äúon that balco, on that new juice‚Äù in an interview with Paul pierce, relating to why his son Bronny wouldn‚Äôt be able to get a bucket on him, even at an older age. Pierce didn‚Äôt fight the point. And you can‚Äôt say KG is a hater. This is the same dude that said Bron is ‚Äúat the TOP of the list‚Äù when referring to all time greats. And in the context of his quote, he was backing up lebron. 
Also, Balco in particular was a scandal involving the use of banned substances, performance enhancing drugs. The PED‚Äôs used in the scandal was called ‚Äúthe clear‚Äù, an undetectable steroid.
This scandal was backed by its founder, Victor Conte. 
Kg also said that the media and companies partnered with lebron are protecting him. 
And, this is only Kg‚Äôs FOURTH time of hinting at lebron using steroids. 
-The media/public is fine with accusing sports  players, such as Barry Bonds, for using drugs, while never failing a drug test. But when it comes to Bron, silence. It‚Äôs favoritism.

After the 2024 all star game, in an interview, lebron said that ‚Äúmost games (regular season) are are starting to look like that too.‚Äù
Referring to the all star game as soft and non competitive with little defense.
LEBRON JAMES HIMSELF HAS SAID THAT THE LEAGUE IS SOFT NOW. 
MEANING THAT THE COMPETITION TODAY ISNT AS GOOD AS BEFORE &amp; THAT MEANS THAT LEBRON IS ALSO SOFT 

I can‚Äôt make a claim that this is an absolute truth, but looking at the facts and circumstances of this situation, I personally believe that lebron is on the juice.

Pays the media to praise him (allegedly).

Constantly lies.

Not even top 10.

Overrated.

Lebron‚Äôs only good years 

Lebron has been cheating the game since 2009, so you can‚Äôt really count the years of 2009-present as true greatness.
From the juicing (allegedly) to him going behind the scenes as LeGM to him paying the media to help him, his career after this point can‚Äôt be respected. 

Let‚Äôs look at the years before lebron started to cheat the game (2003-04 to 2007-08)

Stats: 27ppg/7rpg/6apg/1.7spg/0.8bpg/3tpg/9.8fgm/21.16fga/46.5%fg/1.3 3ptm/4 3pta/32% 3pt/6.3 ftm/8.7 fta/73% ft/ 

Accolades (excluding the ROTY because he stole it from Melo): 2 bronze medals/1 gold medal/ECF championship/all rookie 1st team/4x all star/2x all nba 1st team/2x all nba 2nd team/2008 scoring champion/2x asg mvp/ 

Highlights: Got to the finals in 2007, scoring title in 2008, gold medal in 2008

Lowlights: Swept in 2007 (due to his poor play), two bronze medals on stacked team USA teams, missed the playoffs twice, destroyed in playoffs in 2005-06 and 2007-08

A player with only 5 decent years of play without cheating, having bad shooting splits, meltdowns, and being allowed to carry, travel, commit offensive fouls, flop, and facing weak defensive coverage as a player. And not making a single all defensive team. 

His chances of being a top 75 player with this resume is 70% MAX. And if we deduct points for how easy he had it for things such as his traveling and carrying being allowed, then in reality it‚Äôs 50%. Is this your king? An overblown role player?

And if I‚Äôm being generous and give him up until 2011, where more damning evidence truly came out, excluding the two MVPs he stole, he‚Äôd only have 2 more all stars and all NBAs, 2 all defensive teams, and two choking jobs in the playoffs of 09 and 10. He‚Äôd still be an overblown role player.

"LeBron is the ONLY player to ever officially play all 5 positions.

LeBron is the ONLY player to ever come back from a 3-1 in the finals AND he did it against the BEST team of all time (73-9). In that point in time, the Warriors haven't lost 3 games in a row in *3* years.

LeBron is #1 in points of all time. LeBron is #4 in assists of all time. LeBron is #8 in steals all time. LeBron also became the ONLY player to be in the top 100 all-time list in all stats (points, assists, rebounds, steals, blocks, 3 Pointers).

Winning 4 championships with 4 different teams, at 4 different times is much more impressive than winning 6 at the same time with the same exact (super) team - It shows the reason for the 4 wins is actually LeBron.

Jordan was 193‚Äì187 wins (0.528 win%) without Pippen in his career in regular games. 

LeBron is in his 21st season putting up 25 points, 7 assists and 7 rebounds per game on 52% shooting!!. While other players (Like Vince Carter, Kevin Garnett, Dirk Nowitzki... ) averaged 7 points per game on their 21st season.
(Not to mention he is about to be the first player to ever reach 40,000 career points) He is 39 years old.

LeBron managed to get to the NBA finals (10 times), more times than HALF of the NBA teams in the NBA - that's absolutely crazy.

LeBron has the most 4-0 wins in NBA playoffs - he has 12. that means that 12 different times LeBron and his team won against another team 4 times before losing to them even once.

"I shared this story to my family and friends but never on the Internet cause this happened a loongg time ago. Plus, it was pretty random and i was like 18 at the time but this is my true, long, random, lame, Lebron James story. 

Tldr: I went to a nightclub, saw a baddie, wanted to grind on her, was searching for her the whole night, she got lifted up and daggered aggressively by a big dude, soul got crushed, told myself everything happens for a reason, left the club, caught the train to go back home, got out the train station, randomly walked past Lebron and his wife with no security in lower Manhattan but I couldn't take any pics cause my phone battery died.

True story happened in the middle of the night in lower Manhattan on January 12th, 2014.(This is Miami LeBron by the way)

So I was like 18 at the time and once I turned 18, I used to go to alot of dancehall parties in the city. I seen there was a dancehall party in Brooklyn on Facebook. I wasn't doing anything that Saturday so I wanted to go. 
Fast forward to that day, I pulled up to the dancehall party in Brooklyn. It was at a nightclub. It was active,¬†I seen alot of good looking girls at the club, alot of people were there, but there was this one girl that caught my eye. 

Yo she was Bad!!! Caramel complexion, curly hair girl about 5'3 And she had a nice curvy body. 

So I was like nah before I leave this party I got to whine on her.(Whining means grinding on a female) I was eyeing her the whole time but this club was packed so i couldn't really move around like that. I was 18 so I was still hesitant with the baddies but i had to whine on her. I HAD TO. 

So I seen she had a friend and she was bad too but I was more interested in the curly hair girl. So I was making my moves. It was a dancehall party but They was playing hella trap music too, they was playing woke up in a new buggatti, drunk in love etc. regardless of that, I was making moves to position myself so when they start playing the dancehall songs, I can start whining on the curly hair girl. Yo, so I remember I seen her friend close by and they started playing the dancehall songs.¬†so i start whining on her friend and she was enjoying the whining and we were grinding on each other for a while but I really was grinding on her so I can grind on her friend. 

So after they stopped playing the dancehall songs it went back to trap. And me and the curly hair girl's friend stopped dancing, I remember I went to the bathroom and niggas was trying to sell me pills but I wasn't with it. I just wanted to pee but I lost the curly hair girl in my sight . So I'm in the club, mind you im still 18 so I was kinda just looking for her the whole time, wandering around the nightclub, trying to position myself for the next dancehall song to grind too.¬†¬†

I finally spotted the curly hair girl so I was gonna make my move towards her but the dj started playing dancehall songs. then I remember an arm patted me from the middle of the crowd and a hand was sticking out. I grabbed the hand and it was her friend so we started whining on each other again.

her friend was really feeling me but I really wanted to whine on the curly hair girl,( looking back at it now, I should have made a move on her friend but my selfish ass was focused on that curly hair girl.) 

So we're grinding on each other right and the songs switched back to trap . the friend went back to the curly hair girl and I followed her.

 Now, I was in the perfect position to whine on the curly hair girl. So after a couple songs¬†, the dj start playing some dancehall song but i was hesitanting for awhile to make my move. I was talking to myself and telling myself just go, stop being a pussy, just go. And as soon as I was about to go and whine on her. Some big ass dude comes outta nowhere and just starts grinding on her so im like fuckk. 

Tell me why the dude tells her to turn around, facing him and he lifts her up and starts daggering the girl( dry humping her in the air). I mean daggering her like hard-core bro, I kid you not, I swear I'm not making this up. They made a circle in the crowd and everyone was just vibing watching the girl get Daggered hard like rammed.

 Bruh that deflated my soul bro. Like mind you, I don't even know the girl but the fact that I spent the whole night in the club looking for her, making moves to whine on her, just for her to get daggered like that, yo that crushed my soul. I watched that whole thing unfold. Like dude popped up out nowhere from the left side and he went for it and Daggered her. And after they were done. dude picked up the girl and left the spot.

 Bruh I had to give myself a serious talk, like it was still late but the club wasn't about to close but after that I just wanted to go home, that shit killed my vibe. I told myself, yo shit like that happens for a reason. you gotta work on yourself bro, dont chase these hoes, you got to hit the gym and work on yourself and you'll get all the hoes trust me,  work on yourself, just leave the club. all of this happened for a reason. 

So I left the club. So im going home. I had to take the 2 train to Wall street to go back home to Shaolin and catch the ferry. But my phone had low battery. So im looking down at my iPhone to see if im walking the right way on Google maps to the ferry and as I'm walking I see a huge ass black guy with his wife  and we're just staring at each other for like 5 seconds as we walk close towards each other on the same sidewalk.

 In my mind im like yo "" this dude look like a big ass statute....He look like Lebron.""

So eventually, he walks passed me with his wife. It took like 5 seconds for his and his wife's face to processed in my mind. Then I looked back and seen his shoulders and im like yoo is that LeBron?

 But then in my mind i was like ""nah what would LeBron James be doing in lower Manhattan in the middle of the night."" Im a Knicks fan and the heat wasnt playing the Knicks so it didn't make sense but I went on Google to type the heats schedule and they were playing the Brooklyn nets. 

(This happened late at night on January 12th 2014. The Heat played the nets on the 11th.)

 I was like yoo what the fuck And looked back again and it hit me that was Lebron. So they were already 2 blocks ahead of me with no security. I said lebron outloud but not too loud and they kept walking, I didn't want to run up on him and his wife cause I didn't want random people or pappazari to storm them and ruin that moment that they had together cause I bet they probably don't get moments like that to themselves that often cause of their super famous. Especially having moments without people asking for your autograph, so I just watched them walking away as they turned the corner. 


Im remember telling myself, "" yo if you work hard on yourself and your goals you can probably tell them this story one day."" I was like 18 at the time and that was like a once in a lifetime opportunity to get a pic but my phone eventually died so I couldn't even take a pic of their backs but yeah man if it was for that curly hair girl getting Daggered, I wouldn't have walked past Lebron. 

Yep so thats my Lebron James story.","My LeBron James Story. (The Longest, Randomest, Lamest LeBron Story Ever.)",lebron,"My LeBron James Story. (The Longest, Randomest, Lamest LeBron Story Ever.) I shared this story to my family and friends but never on the Internet cause this happened a loongg time ago. Plus, it was pretty random and i was like 18 at the time but this is my true, long, random, lame, Lebron James story. 

Tldr: I went to a nightclub, saw a baddie, wanted to grind on her, was searching for her the whole night, she got lifted up and daggered aggressively by a big dude, soul got crushed, told myself everything happens for a reason, left the club, caught the train to go back home, got out the train station, randomly walked past Lebron and his wife with no security in lower Manhattan but I couldn't take any pics cause my phone battery died.

True story happened in the middle of the night in lower Manhattan on January 12th, 2014.(This is Miami LeBron by the way)

So I was like 18 at the time and once I turned 18, I used to go to alot of dancehall parties in the city. I seen there was a dancehall party in Brooklyn on Facebook. I wasn't doing anything that Saturday so I wanted to go. 
Fast forward to that day, I pulled up to the dancehall party in Brooklyn. It was at a nightclub. It was active,¬†I seen alot of good looking girls at the club, alot of people were there, but there was this one girl that caught my eye. 

Yo she was Bad!!! Caramel complexion, curly hair girl about 5'3 And she had a nice curvy body. 

So I was like nah before I leave this party I got to whine on her.(Whining means grinding on a female) I was eyeing her the whole time but this club was packed so i couldn't really move around like that. I was 18 so I was still hesitant with the baddies but i had to whine on her. I HAD TO. 

So I seen she had a friend and she was bad too but I was more interested in the curly hair girl. So I was making my moves. It was a dancehall party but They was playing hella trap music too, they was playing woke up in a new buggatti, drunk in love etc. regardless of that, I was making moves to position myself so when they start playing the dancehall songs, I can start whining on the curly hair girl. Yo, so I remember I seen her friend close by and they started playing the dancehall songs.¬†so i start whining on her friend and she was enjoying the whining and we were grinding on each other for a while but I really was grinding on her so I can grind on her friend. 

So after they stopped playing the dancehall songs it went back to trap. And me and the curly hair girl's friend stopped dancing, I remember I went to the bathroom and niggas was trying to sell me pills but I wasn't with it. I just wanted to pee but I lost the curly hair girl in my sight .

Hey, a LeBron James is a s** move, and you're going to need 4 items.

You need a chair, a headband, some baby powder and a b\***ch. with a strong neck. So you're going to have your strong neck b\***ch sit in the chair.

She's going to tilt her head all the way back. Her mouth needs to be pointed straight up towards the ceiling.

You are going to take 20 to 25 steps back and go ahead and put your headband on. You can be playing some theme music in the background, by the way. But after you got your headband on, I want you to grab the baby powder, clap your hands together, throw that shit in the sky like Bron-Bron. üôåüèΩüí®

Then I want you to run towards this b\***ch. üèÉüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

When you get close, I want you to leap in the air. When you jump up in the air, pull your d**k up and spread your legs so only your balls hanging down.

And I want you to try to dunk your balls in this b\***ch's mouth. No teeth, no lips, just mouth.

But if you hear a little cracking sound in her neck, just like Bron-Bron, don't look back, don't touch the b\***ch. 

Take your talents to South Beach. üèÄüèÜ

Obviously Wade aging, Bosh blood clots, and the rise of the Warriors would have been huge obstacles. But the Heat would have adapted. In my opinion, if LeBron stayed he‚Äôd have at least the same number of championships he does now, but probably more.

In the end he got what he wanted tho, to call the shots and control roster and coaching decisions. Definitely wasn‚Äôt happening here. And we‚Äôre just fine without him.

The 1994-95 version of MJ is likely the last time everyone would witness that certain Michael Jordan from the First 3-peat era (In terms of the playing style and athleticism)

He still had that signs of explosive flare from the early 90s version himself, and in some of his great games in that comeback season....He was taking off and still dunking on everybody. (That certain dunk against the Magic)

"Michael Jordan is a top 5 player all time but he's the most overrated player of all time as well.

He lacked the ability to drag bad teams to glory.  He needed to be given the keys to a Ferrari (55 win Pippen led team) to win any races.

Hakeem Olojuwan dragged a trash team to the Finals twice.  Arguably the worst team surrounding a star player and he made them win.

Jordan was also extremely overrated defensively.  Both times he surprised the Bulls and missed time (first was ankle injury, second was first retirement) the Bulls defensive rating improved with him off the team.

Hakeem Olojuwan was the greatest defensive player to ever play the game, and also played the most important position defensively in the game of basketball.

"Updated after LeBron's 14th season. Feel free to copy+paste.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The basics: Michael Jordan, in just ELEVEN full seasons with the Bulls...

‚Ä¢ 6 Championships (3 more than LeBron)

‚Ä¢ 6 Finals MVPs (3 more than LeBron)

‚Ä¢ 6/6 Undefeated finals record (never even allowed a series to go to game 7)

‚Ä¢ That makes 6 rings in 11 full years, LeBron 3 in 15 full seasons and counting.

‚Ä¢ 1 more Defensive Player of the Year (LeBron won 0)

‚Ä¢ 1 more Regular Season MVP (5 for MJ)

‚Ä¢ 9 more Scoring Titles (10 with 7 STRAIGHT for MJ, no one in history comes close)

‚Ä¢ 3 more Steals Leader (LeBron has 0)

‚Ä¢ 3 more All-Defensive Team selections (9 for MJ)


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Some numbers to begin with:

‚Ä¢ Michael Jordan has 39 NBA Playoff records (again, in just 11 full seasons with the Bulls). LeBron has 23 (after 14 full seasons). 

‚Ä¢ In '88-89, MJ averaged 32ppg, 8apg, 8rpg, 3spg at 54% shooting for the season, with no other All-stars on his team.

‚Ä¢ In just his 3rd year, MJ averaged 35ppg and became the only player in NBA history to win the Scoring Title, league MVP, and Defensive Player of the Year in the SAME SEASON, proving he was by far the best offensive AND defensive player in the league. Something LeBron has never done.

‚Ä¢ Jordan is also the only player in history to win Scoring Title, MVP, All-Star MVP, Slam Dunk Champion, and Defensive Player of The Year.

‚Ä¢ MJ is the only player in NBA history with more than one season of 200 steals and 100 blocks

‚Ä¢ MJ put up at least 40ppg, 5rpg, 5apg, 3spg and 2bpg on 55% shooting, in 6 different Playoff series. He won every one of those match-ups except for the '86 match-up vs the 67-win Larry Bird Celtics dynasty (arguably greatest NBA team of all time) with no All-star teammates. 

‚Ä¢ In the '91 Finals against Magic's Lakers, MJ averaged 31.2ppg, 11.4apg, 6.6rpg, 2.8spg, 1.8bpg on 56% shooting to win his first ring, proving to critics that he can be just as good of a playmaker as Magic Johnson if he really needed to.

‚Ä¢ In fact MJ had a historic stretch of 10 triple-doubles in 11 games when Doug Collins decided to put him at Point Guard.

‚Ä¢ In the '93 NBA Finals, against PHX who had the best record (62 wins), the league MVP (Charles Barkley) and 2 All-stars, MJ averaged a staggering 41.0ppg, 6.3ast, 8.5rpg, 1.7stls, on 50% shooting. 

‚Ä¢ MJ is the only guard in NBA history to lead his team in all 5 categories (pts, reb, asst, stls, blks) during a Playoff series. He came close (&lt;5 reb short) to doing this three more times

‚Ä¢ In '97 MJ came just 9 rebounds and 1 block shy of becoming the only player in NBA history to lead a Championship team in all 5 main categories for the season (pts, reb, asst, stls, blks)


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
""More with less""

‚Ä¢ All-star appearances by teammates (total): MJ 11, LBJ 44

‚Ä¢ MJ beat 20 50+ win teams in the Playoffs. LeBron only defeated 10 in his entire career playing in the weaker Eastern Conference. At least 4 of the top 6 teams in the league have been in the West in all of LeBron's 8 Finals appearances.

‚Ä¢ Number of 60+win teams beat during title seasons: MJ 7 vs LBJ 1

‚Ä¢ MJ is the only player in NBA history to lead a team to a Championship with only one teammate averaging double digits in scoring (Scottie Pippen with 19ppg on 42%, the rest of the team less than 8ppg).

‚Ä¢ Jordan never had a single teammate averaging more than 22ppg in the Finals. LeBron had Kyrie Irving (28ppg) and Dwyane Wade (26ppg), to go along with Chris Bosh (18ppg) and Kevin Love (16ppg). 

‚Ä¢ Jordan had 1 All-Star teammate (Pippen) throughout his ENTIRE career. Dennis Rodman was 37 yrs old when he played with MJ and was a great rebounder+defensive role player.

‚Ä¢ Scottie Pippen averaged 7.9ppg, 3.8rpg, 2.1apg as a rookie coming off the bench (can you name ANY other teammate of MJ's from the 80s?). Pippen was drafted and developed into All-Star-level talent after scrimmaging against MJ during the famously brutal Bulls practices over three seasons (a moderate 16.1ppg, 6.4rpg, 5.2apg for his career). This is when the Bulls finally broke through the 'Bad Boy' Detroit Pistons, the two-time defending Champs that had de-throned Larry Bird's Celtics and Magic &amp; Kareem's Lakers dynasties. 

‚Ä¢ These '88-91 Detroit Pistons were not ""old"" when they got SWEPT by MJ's Bulls in '91: Isiah Thomas (30), Joe Dumars (28), Dennis Rodman (30), and Bill Laimbeer (33). In this series, against 3 Hall of Famers and arguably the best defensive team in NBA history, MJ averaged 30ppg, 5.3rpg, 7apg, 2.3spg, 1.9bpg, on 54% shooting.

‚Ä¢ In the 2014 Finals, LeBron's Miami superteam lost by a record margin to an ACTUALLY OLD Spurs team with Tim Duncan (38), Manu Ginobili (37), and Tony Parker (32, in his 14th season).

‚Ä¢ LeBron had 5 Hall of Famer teammates over the course of his multi-superteam career: Dwyane Wade (a top 3 SG in NBA history and a proven Champion and Finals MVP before LeBron joined him in Miami), Chris Bosh (a 24ppg &amp; 11rpg perennial All-Star and a top 10 player at the time who single-handedly carried Toronto to the playoffs), Ray Allen (undoubtedly a top 3 shooter in NBA history, who was &gt;35yrs old but still effective in Miami with Championship experience), Kyrie Irving (easily a top 5 PG today, arguably the best ball-handler and rim-finisher in NBA history), and Kevin Love (another perennial 26ppg &amp; 13rpg All-star and previous MVP candidate before joining LeBron). 

‚Ä¢ Despite playing on a superteam with two other top-10 players, LeBron had a historic meltdown in the 2011 NBA finals against the Mavs, when he choked against role players like Jason Terry and JJ Barea in four consecutive 4th quarters (17ppg on 35%fg). MJ never had an under-performing Playoff series at ANY point of his career, EVER. Zero.

‚Ä¢ Jordan also never averaged less than 40% FG in the finals, LeBron did it twice.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Myths and misconceptions:

‚Ä¢ MJ being 1-9 in the 1st round of the Playoffs in his first 3 years is a misleading stat. 1-9 refers to games won-lost, not series won-lost (0-3). He carried a team of no-names to the playoffs (again, can you name a single teammate of MJ's from '84-87?), all of these instances running into 59+win teams including the 67-win '86 Boston Celtics in their absolute prime. MJ still did his part by dropping an NBA Playoff record 63 points against them in the Boston Garden, to which Larry Bird famously reacted by calling him ""God disguised as Michael Jordan"" (mind you, Larry Bird NEVER complimented his opponents like that). LeBron didn't even make it to the Playoffs his first two years in the league against weaker competition.

‚Ä¢ When MJ retired in his prime to play baseball for 2 years, the Bulls were still projected to have a winning record (ended up with 55 wins) because: 1) they retained the same core players with the same coaching &amp; Triangle system that won them 3 straight titles, 2) they then added multiple pieces to make up for MJ's absence, including Steve Kerr (all-time leader in 3pt%), Tony Kukoc (the original stretch-four and future 6th Man of the Year), Luc Longley (an Andrew Bogut-type center drafted at #7), etc., and 3) Scottie Pippen was on a personal mission to prove himself after years of playing in MJ's shadow. When LeBron left Miami to join younger All-stars in Cleveland (yet again), Miami still made the Playoffs and would have gone on a deeper run had it not been for Chris Bosh's injury &amp; health issues that ultimately ended his career short.

‚Ä¢ When MJ came back from his 1st retirement out of shape with only 17 games left in the season, the Bulls lost to a 60-win Orlando team led by Shaq in his athletic prime and Penny Hardaway, who was considered the future of the NBA prior to injuries. Jordan returned the next year and SWEPT them. He led the Bulls to a Championship along with 72 wins that season, the NBA record at the time (72-10).

‚Ä¢ LeBron ""never had great coaching"". This is actually partly true. But what did Phil Jackson EVER achieve without MJ/Pippen, Shaq/Kobe, or Kobe/Gasol? What did Gregg Popovich ever win without Tim Duncan? Pat Riley without Magic/Kareem, or Shaq/D-Wade? K.C. Jones without Larry Bird? Coaching is obviously important, and is key to bringing out the best in a player, but great coaches are ultimately made by great players more so than the other way around. In the end it's the players who get the job done on the court.  

‚Ä¢ LeBron ""makes his teammates better""? How much better did he make Chris Bosh and Kevin Love (again, both were franchise players before playing with LeBron), or even decent role pieces like JR Smith, Jae Crowder, Rodney Hood, Larry Nance Jr., Jordan Clarkson? For those LeBron fans that love numbers, check their stats before and after playing with LeBron. The only guys that really benefit from LeBron are spot-up shooters like Ray Allen, Mike Miller, and Kyle Korver. Think real hard about this: LeBron is a playmaker and puts up great assist numbers, but does he actually bring out the best in his teammates? Does he really make their jobs easier?


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Some more numbers:

‚Ä¢ Michael Jordan is of course best known for his scoring ability and holds the highest scoring average EVER in the Playoffs: 33.4 ppg for his career (yes, that's even higher than Wilt Chamberlain of the 60's) on 49% shooting.

‚Ä¢ MJ also has the highest scoring average EVER in the regular season: 30.1 ppg for his career on 50% shooting. This is including his Wizards years which brought down his stats overall.

‚Ä¢ Remember MJ played in the 80s/90s when hand-checking was allowed (limiting players' offensive freedom/mobility at the perimeter), and all-time Bigs like Patrick Ewing, Hakeem Olajuwon, David Robinson, Shaquille O'Neal, Robert Parish, Alonzo Mourning, Charles Barkley, Karl Malone, Shawn Kemp, and Dikembe Mutumbo were protecting the rim if he drove the lane. LeBron struggled against dudes like Dwight Howard and Roy Hibbert.

‚Ä¢ Against a tougher defense, Jordan averaged a staggering 37.1ppg for an ENTIRE SEASON ('87). 

‚Ä¢ By just his 3rd year in the leauge, MJ had a 50-pt game against every single Eastern Conference team

‚Ä¢ MJ also has eight 50-point games in the Playoffs. Wilt Chamberlain is second, with just two.

‚Ä¢ In his famous 69-point game against the Blazers, not many people know MJ also grabbed 18 rebounds, 6 assists, and 4 stls

‚Ä¢ MJ also dropped 51pts at age 38 (2002), becoming the oldest player ever to score &gt;50 in a game. This was when MJ was part-owner/player for the Wizards, skipping practice and smoking cigars before games.

‚Ä¢ In '87-92, MJ averaged 5 straight seasons of at least 51% FG shooting. LeBron has never done this. 

‚Ä¢ MJ shoots a career 84%FT from the free-throw line. LeBron is well below the NBA average at 74% (his highest EVER in a season is 78%), which makes him a potential liability at the end of games.

‚Ä¢ LeBron has the worst FT% in the last 10 seconds of a one-possession game of ANY player over the last 20 seasons (47%FT).

‚Ä¢ Game-tying/winning shots in the final 24 seconds: MJ 50%fg (9-18), LBJ 35%fg (8-23)

‚Ä¢ MJ has the highest career PER (player efficiency rating) in NBA history, with 27.91   

‚Ä¢ MJ also has a higher Playoff PER (player efficiency rating) of 28.6 to LeBrons 27.3

‚Ä¢ MJ's PER increases in the Playoffs, but LeBron's PER decreases

‚Ä¢ LeBron averages just 1.3 more assists than MJ in the Playoffs, but MJ has a lower assist:turnover ratio (LeBron is 5th all time in turnovers).

‚Ä¢ LeBron has been in the top 10 in turnovers for 14 seasons

‚Ä¢ Playoff series averaging 5+ turnovers: MJ 0 vs LBJ 2


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sheer dominance:

‚Ä¢ Jordan OWNED the entire decade of the 90s: he won 3 straight titles, retired IN HIS PRIME, then came back and won another 3 straight. Two ""three-peats"". Something never done by anyone in sports history. 

‚Ä¢ Imagine what more he could've done, had he not retired at the peak of his career.

‚Ä¢ During this span, MJ prevented at least 7 Hall of Famers from EVER winning a Championship. 

‚Ä¢ MJ led the 1995‚Äì96 Chicago Bulls to the best combined regular season and postseason record in NBA history: 87-13. That's a staggering 87%.

‚Ä¢ In his final game as a Chicago Bull, in the very last minute of Game 6 of the '98 finals against Utah, MJ ripped the ball away from Karl Malone, brought it up the floor, and made a game-winning shot over Russell to win his 6th Championship in 8 years, in what became the most iconic and symbolic ending to a near-unblemished career. 

‚Ä¢ Michael ""Air"" Jordan transcended the game, globalized the sport. No one in SPORTS HISTORY can touch his legacy, fame, and impact. It's been almost 20 years since he retired, and we're still talking about him and wearing his shoes.
 
‚Ä¢ MJ is half the reason y'all are ballin right now, even if you're too young to have ever seen him play in his prime

‚Ä¢ The same goes for LeBron James, who wears #23 because of MJ.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
LeBron is amazing and will no doubt go down as one of the top 3 greatest of all time -- he's bigger, more durable, and is clearly a better playmaker than MJ. His career totals will easily pass everyone else's, coming straight out of high school and playing an extended career free of any major injury (knock on wood!). He is probably the most 'naturally gifted' player in history, in terms of size, athleticism and basketball IQ -- which is why sometimes we unfairly view him as an ""underachiever"". I will even go as far as to say he is possibly the best EVER at upgrading a bad team into a good playoff team, given his versatility (other than maybe Magic Johnson). But ironically, his versatility is also a curse, because while it results in great individual stats and assist numbers, his ball-dominant style (over-dribbling at times, playing 'downhill bully ball', limiting team ball movement) does not create synergy with teammates and does not translate particularly well to winning at the biggest stage against teams that run on a free-flowing SYSTEM (Spurs, Celtics, Warriors, etc.). You can try to argue that he's outmatched by the Warriors right now, and maybe that's fair, but losing to teams like GSW or the Spurs is also a testament to some glaring limitations in his game and playing style. You also can't deny that LeBron is the one who set the precedent (twice!) for joining Superstar talent ('All is forgiven if you win rings') and is THE major reason why KD decided to join GSW. LeBron is also the main reason why Kyrie Irving left Cleveland, and is the one who got JR Smith and TT ridiculous contracts that still limit the team's options. So having a losing record 3-5 in the Finals is not JUST a product of bad luck or lack of help. It's in fact reflective of his game (knowing how to play one style and one style only), clear weaknesses that others can exploit as a team, and an overly sensitive ego that sometimes impedes team chemistry. 

While MJ averaged 1~2 fewer assists/rebounds than LeBron in his career, MJ had no weaknesses in his game that opposing teams could take advantage of. NONE. Zero. Everyone knew exactly what he was going to do, and there was nothing they could do about it. He was the first super-athlete who was also technically flawless on both ends of the floor. He was an unstoppable scorer, but didn't need to stagnate the offense in order to get his team a bucket. He was as complete and efficient a player could possibly be in his position, and set the bar for the whole league with his overwhelming individual dominance. He stepped up his game to another level in the Playoffs, Finals, and in the 4th quarters of the biggest games. To this day, he is universally described as the mentally toughest athlete in sports history, to the point that many would say he was pathologically competitive. He trash-talked his opponents into misery like no other, and backed it up like no other while doing so. Simply put, MJ had a mental and physical 'invincibility factor' that no one in history comes close to, and that's really what separates him from other all-time greats.

In the end, when it comes to great players like MJ or LBJ, the most important and all-encompassing 'stat', is how many Championships they win -- which is why Bill Russell, no matter how long ago he played, on stacked teams, will always at least be mentioned with 11 championships in 13 years. Obviously rings aren't everything and context is important, but greatness is ultimately built on storied moments and achievements. The most important 'skill' on an actual basketball court? Whether you like it or not, the answer will always be scoring ability, and that is the harsh and boring truth. Because in the end, you play the game in order to put the ball in the basket. You play to do this more frequently than the opposing team. You play for the score board, NOT the stat sheet. You play to win. This is why MJ will ALWAYS be in the discussion, for years to come.

""Greatness"" comes with both individual and team ACCOMPLISHMENTS, before anything else. 

and MJ = easily the greatest combination of individual dominance and team dominance. Not close.

The basics: Michael Jordan, in just ELEVEN full seasons with the Bulls...

‚Ä¢ 6 Championships (3 more than LeBron)

‚Ä¢ 6 Finals MVPs (3 more than LeBron)

‚Ä¢ 6/6 Undefeated finals record (never even allowed a series to go to game 7)

‚Ä¢ That makes 6 rings in 11 full years, LeBron 3 in 15 full seasons and counting.

‚Ä¢ 1 more Defensive Player of the Year (LeBron won 0)

‚Ä¢ 1 more Regular Season MVP (5 for MJ)

‚Ä¢ 9 more Scoring Titles (10 with 7 STRAIGHT for MJ, no one in history comes close)

‚Ä¢ 3 more Steals Leader (LeBron has 0)

‚Ä¢ 3 more All-Defensive Team selections (9 for MJ)


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Some numbers to begin with:

‚Ä¢ Michael Jordan has 39 NBA Playoff records (again, in just 11 full seasons with the Bulls). LeBron has 23 (after 14 full seasons). 

‚Ä¢ In '88-89, MJ averaged 32ppg, 8apg, 8rpg, 3spg at 54% shooting for the season, with no other All-stars on his team.

‚Ä¢ In just his 3rd year, MJ averaged 35ppg and became the only player in NBA history to win the Scoring Title, league MVP, and Defensive Player of the Year in the SAME SEASON, proving he was by far the best offensive AND defensive player in the league. Something LeBron has never done.

‚Ä¢ Jordan is also the only player in history to win Scoring Title, MVP, All-Star MVP, Slam Dunk Champion, and Defensive Player of The Year.

‚Ä¢ MJ is the only player in NBA history with more than one season of 200 steals and 100 blocks

‚Ä¢ MJ put up at least 40ppg, 5rpg, 5apg, 3spg and 2bpg on 55% shooting, in 6 different Playoff series. He won every one of those match-ups except for the '86 match-up vs the 67-win Larry Bird Celtics dynasty (arguably greatest NBA team of all time) with no All-star teammates. 

‚Ä¢ In the '91 Finals against Magic's Lakers, MJ averaged 31.2ppg, 11.4apg, 6.6rpg, 2.8spg, 1.8bpg on 56% shooting to win his first ring, proving to critics that he can be just as good of a playmaker as Magic Johnson if he really needed to.

‚Ä¢ In fact MJ had a historic stretch of 10 triple-doubles in 11 games when Doug Collins decided to put him at Point Guard.

‚Ä¢ In the '93 NBA Finals, against PHX who had the best record (62 wins), the league MVP (Charles Barkley) and 2 All-stars, MJ averaged a staggering 41.0ppg, 6.3ast, 8.5rpg, 1.7stls, on 50% shooting. 

‚Ä¢ MJ is the only guard in NBA history to lead his team in all 5 categories (pts, reb, asst, stls, blks) during a Playoff series. He came close (&lt;5 reb short) to doing this three more times

‚Ä¢ In '97 MJ came just 9 rebounds and 1 block shy of becoming the only player in NBA history to lead a Championship team in all 5 main categories for the season (pts, reb, asst, stls, blks)


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
""More with less""

‚Ä¢ All-star appearances by teammates (total): MJ 11, LBJ 44

‚Ä¢ MJ beat 20 50+ win teams in the Playoffs. LeBron only defeated 10 in his entire career playing in the weaker Eastern Conference. At least 4 of the top 6 teams in the league have been in the West in all of LeBron's 8 Finals appearances.

‚Ä¢ Number of 60+win teams beat during title seasons: MJ 7 vs LBJ 1

‚Ä¢ MJ is the only player in NBA history to lead a team to a Championship with only one teammate averaging double digits in scoring (Scottie Pippen with 19ppg on 42%, the rest of the team less than 8ppg).

‚Ä¢ Jordan never had a single teammate averaging more than 22ppg in the Finals. LeBron had Kyrie Irving (28ppg) and Dwyane Wade (26ppg), to go along with Chris Bosh (18ppg) and Kevin Love (16ppg). 

‚Ä¢ Jordan had 1 All-Star teammate (Pippen) throughout his ENTIRE career. Dennis Rodman was 37 yrs old when he played with MJ and was a great rebounder+defensive role player.

‚Ä¢ Scottie Pippen averaged 7.9ppg, 3.8rpg, 2.1apg as a rookie coming off the bench (can you name ANY other teammate of MJ's from the 80s?). Pippen was drafted and developed into All-Star-level talent after scrimmaging against MJ during the famously brutal Bulls practices over three seasons (a moderate 16.1ppg, 6.4rpg, 5.2apg for his career). This is when the Bulls finally broke through the 'Bad Boy' Detroit Pistons, the two-time defending Champs that had de-throned Larry Bird's Celtics and Magic &amp; Kareem's Lakers dynasties. 

‚Ä¢ These '88-91 Detroit Pistons were not ""old"" when they got SWEPT by MJ's Bulls in '91: Isiah Thomas (30), Joe Dumars (28), Dennis Rodman (30), and Bill Laimbeer (33). In this series, against 3 Hall of Famers and arguably the best defensive team in NBA history, MJ averaged 30ppg, 5.3rpg, 7apg, 2.3spg, 1.9bpg, on 54% shooting.

‚Ä¢ In the 2014 Finals, LeBron's Miami superteam lost by a record margin to an ACTUALLY OLD Spurs team with Tim Duncan (38), Manu Ginobili (37), and Tony Parker (32, in his 14th season).

‚Ä¢ LeBron had 5 Hall of Famer teammates over the course of his multi-superteam career: Dwyane Wade (a top 3 SG in NBA history and a proven Champion and Finals MVP before LeBron joined him in Miami), Chris Bosh (a 24ppg &amp; 11rpg perennial All-Star and a top 10 player at the time who single-handedly carried Toronto to the playoffs), Ray Allen (undoubtedly a top 3 shooter in NBA history, who was &gt;35yrs old but still effective in Miami with Championship experience), Kyrie Irving (easily a top 5 PG today, arguably the best ball-handler and rim-finisher in NBA history), and Kevin Love (another perennial 26ppg &amp; 13rpg All-star and previous MVP candidate before joining LeBron). 

‚Ä¢ Despite playing on a superteam with two other top-10 players, LeBron had a historic meltdown in the 2011 NBA finals against the Mavs, when he choked against role players like Jason Terry and JJ Barea in four consecutive 4th quarters (17ppg on 35%fg). MJ never had an under-performing Playoff series at ANY point of his career, EVER. Zero.

‚Ä¢ Jordan also never averaged less than 40% FG in the finals, LeBron did it twice.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Myths and misconceptions:

‚Ä¢ MJ being 1-9 in the 1st round of the Playoffs in his first 3 years is a misleading stat. 1-9 refers to games won-lost, not series won-lost (0-3). He carried a team of no-names to the playoffs (again, can you name a single teammate of MJ's from '84-87?), all of these instances running into 59+win teams including the 67-win '86 Boston Celtics in their absolute prime. MJ still did his part by dropping an NBA Playoff record 63 points against them in the Boston Garden, to which Larry Bird famously reacted by calling him ""God disguised as Michael Jordan"" (mind you, Larry Bird NEVER complimented his opponents like that).

When LeBron left Miami to join younger All-stars in Cleveland (yet again), Miami still made the Playoffs and would have gone on a deeper run had it not been for Chris Bosh's injury &amp; health issues that ultimately ended his career short.

‚Ä¢ When MJ came back from his 1st retirement out of shape with only 17 games left in the season, the Bulls lost to a 60-win Orlando team led by Shaq in his athletic prime and Penny Hardaway, who was considered the future of the NBA prior to injuries. Jordan returned the next year and SWEPT them. He led the Bulls to a Championship along with 72 wins that season, the NBA record at the time (72-10).

‚Ä¢ LeBron ""never had great coaching"". This is actually partly true. But what did Phil Jackson EVER achieve without MJ/Pippen, Shaq/Kobe, or Kobe/Gasol? What did Gregg Popovich ever win without Tim Duncan? Pat Riley without Magic/Kareem, or Shaq/D-Wade? K.C. Jones without Larry Bird? Coaching is obviously important, and is key to bringing out the best in a player, but great coaches are ultimately made by great players more so than the other way around. In the end it's the players who get the job done on the court.  

‚Ä¢ LeBron ""makes his teammates better""?

‚Ä¢ In '87-92, MJ averaged 5 straight seasons of at least 51% FG shooting. LeBron has never done this. 

‚Ä¢ MJ shoots a career 84%FT from the free-throw line. LeBron is well below the NBA average at 74% (his highest EVER in a season is 78%), which makes him a potential liability at the end of games.

‚Ä¢ LeBron has the worst FT% in the last 10 seconds of a one-possession game of ANY player over the last 20 seasons (47%FT).

‚Ä¢ Game-tying/winning shots in the final 24 seconds: MJ 50%fg (9-18), LBJ 35%fg (8-23)

‚Ä¢ MJ has the highest career PER (player efficiency rating) in NBA history, with 27.91   

‚Ä¢ MJ also has a higher Playoff PER (player efficiency rating) of 28.6 to LeBrons 27.3

‚Ä¢ MJ's PER increases in the Playoffs, but LeBron's PER decreases

‚Ä¢ LeBron averages just 1.3 more assists than MJ in the Playoffs, but MJ has a lower assist:turnover ratio (LeBron is 5th all time in turnovers).

‚Ä¢ LeBron has been in the top 10 in turnovers for 14 seasons

‚Ä¢ Playoff series averaging 5+ turnovers: MJ 0 vs LBJ 2

Everyone knew exactly what he was going to do, and there was nothing they could do about it. He was the first super-athlete who was also technically flawless on both ends of the floor. He was an unstoppable scorer, but didn't need to stagnate the offense in order to get his team a bucket. He was as complete and efficient a player could possibly be in his position, and set the bar for the whole league with his overwhelming individual dominance. He stepped up his game to another level in the Playoffs, Finals, and in the 4th quarters of the biggest games. To this day, he is universally described as the mentally toughest athlete in sports history, to the point that many would say he was pathologically competitive. He trash-talked his opponents into misery like no other, and backed it up like no other while doing so. Simply put, MJ had a mental and physical 'invincibility factor' that no one in history comes close to, and that's really what separates him from other all-time greats.

In the end, when it comes to great players like MJ or LBJ, the most important and all-encompassing 'stat', is how many Championships they win -- which is why Bill Russell, no matter how long ago he played, on stacked teams, will always at least be mentioned with 11 championships in 13 years. Obviously rings aren't everything and context is important, but greatness is ultimately built on storied moments and achievements. The most important 'skill' on an actual basketball court? Whether you like it or not, the answer will always be scoring ability, and that is the harsh and boring truth. Because in the end, you play the game in order to put the ball in the basket. You play to do this more frequently than the opposing team. You play for the score board, NOT the stat sheet. You play to win. This is why MJ will ALWAYS be in the discussion, for years to come.

""Greatness"" comes with both individual and team ACCOMPLISHMENTS, before anything else. 

and MJ = easily the greatest combination of individual dominance and team dominance. Not close.

"Here's an excerpt to a little piece I wrote on my newsletter. Growing up a huge Kobe and Lakers fan, his work ethic helped guide me throughout high school and college.

This piece meant a lot to me, and I hope it resonates with this community.

https://preview.redd.it/w92hivco3hpc1.png?width=332&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d5f5e3ff2c36eedc9fed76923057f914c3df32a5

## May 5th, 2003.¬†

After three straight years of winning it all, the Los Angeles Lakers had their 4-peat dreams crushed by the San Antonio Spurs in the 2003 Western Conference Semifinals.

Cut to: a stoic 24-year-old Kobe Bryant congratulating his opponents as he slowly makes his way off the court. A reporter from ABC sees the emotional, broken, and tired wonderkid. He senses blood and rushes over to ask a series of tactless, probing questions.

[https://youtu.be/PPBkbib2eh0](https://youtu.be/PPBkbib2eh0)

Kobe, already in his 7th season, navigates and dodges the first two questions like a seasoned veteran. But the final question catches him off guard.

&gt;***How much harder will you work this offseason to get back to the championship?***

The camera zooms in on his face for a few seconds before he answers.¬†

Frustration. Anger. Disbelief. Excitement. A kaleidoscope of emotions.¬†

Kobe can‚Äôt fabricate a response to this one. His eyes sink and with a shaking voice he responds:

&gt;***I‚Äôll push myself to exhaustion.***

In a star-studded series featuring Shaq and Duncan, it was Kobe who led both teams by averaging 32 points on 44 minutes. He left it all out there. Basketball is a team sport, and clearly he wasn‚Äôt the weak link that series. What more could he have possibly done?

*I‚Äôll push myself to exhaustion.*

There are countless inspirational videos on YouTube that worship Kobe‚Äôs work ethic. People will watch these, feel motivated for a few hours, but inevitably fall back into their old habits. Hard work is often glamorized at face value without understanding the engine that drives it. Without a stronger belief to ground yourself on, ‚Äúhard work‚Äù is just another fleeting emotion.

**To Kobe, hard work was the manifestation of a self-reliance mentality.** When faced with adversity, those with a self-reliance mentality understand that there is always room to single-handedly tip the outcome in their favor. You might not always succeed, but you can always give yourself a better chance at it.

A few nights prior, the Lakers had lost Game 5 of the series by a score of 96-94. A mere 2 points. Maybe if Kobe had taken better shots, grabbed more rebounds, or played tighter defense, the Lakers would‚Äôve won that game. And maybe that clutch victory would not only have given the entire Lakers team the series lead, but also the confidence and momentum they needed to win the whole damn thing again for the 4th year in a row.

*I‚Äôll push myself to exhaustion.*

Even when he had every right to blame everyone and everything but himself, Kobe looked inward and understood there was still work to do. What does it mean to bear the full weight of your ambitions? To embrace total responsibility for your own successes and failures?

**The only way to succeed time and time again is to put trust in yourself.**

## June 7, 2009.

One year after a heartbreaking loss against the Boston Celtics in the 2008 championship, Kobe and the Lakers returned to the fray, this time securing a commanding 2-0 series lead over the Orlando Magic in the 2009 NBA finals.

Cut to: A post-game interview with a 30-year-old Kobe. Hardened by years of personal issues and basketball failures, it‚Äôs become impossible to elicit emotion from the league‚Äôs reigning MVP.

[https://youtu.be/FBka7fv5PS4](https://youtu.be/FBka7fv5PS4)

One reporter tries anyways:¬†

&gt;***We‚Äôre still waiting for a big smile out of you. You‚Äôre up 2-0. What‚Äôs the story? Are you not happy? Or are you only half happy?***

Kobe‚Äôs response:

&gt;***What‚Äôs there to be happy about? Job‚Äôs not finished.***

Seven days later, the job would be finished.

Cloaked in royal purple and gold, the Lakers reclaimed their rightful throne as world champions, ascending to the pinnacle of NBA glory for the 15th time in team history.

His thoughts on emotional intelligence stick with me to this day.

Emotional intelligence is key to life. Being aware of your emotions and processing them effectively can make the difference between being controlled by them or using them to your advantage.

In this video, Kobe, talks about his approach and perspective on handling emotions like fear. I admire his method of 'unpacking' emotions to analyze their origins.  For example, the fear of failure can be paralyzing for some. It can prevent many from taking the first step when often, it is really just a case of 'False Evidence Appearing Real.'

How do you deal with challenging emotions like fear or anxiety? Do you have strategies similar to Kobe's, or do you approach them differently?

The concept of breaking down our emotions to their core is fascinating and potentially life-changing.

"Kobe Bryant was my idol. The way he inspired generations of athletes, scholars, artists and everything in between speaks volumes on his work ethic and character. 

For the first time in a very long time I dreamt of him last night, and my heart is gleaming with joy. 

I was working in an ER and Kobe‚Äôs name popped up in the waiting room. I immediately staked my claim with the other nurses. After grabbing him from the waiting room, instead of walking into a patient room we walked into my childhood room. He saw my dedicated Kobe wall and he LOVED it. 

I wish I had more to share but I guess I got so excited I woke up? 

I‚Äôve been dealing with confidence issues while struggling through grad school, and I needed that dream.

"My brother lucked into a single ticket for a Lakers game, last minute. It was behind Jack, second row. I was a huge fan and my brother knew it so he called me up, offered it, and I nabbed it. Off to LA solo.

Fast forward to the beginning of the second half. I'm sitting, facing the court, the Clippers bench is just to my left, the scorers table to the front right, and the Lakers are down to the far right, Jack didn't show up. : (

The players are taking the court. I see Kobe stand up to my right and somewhere in my brain something snapped and I knew exactly what he was going to do!

Kevin Garnett blows the hand powder in the scorers before each half, Lebron throws it in the air, Kobe gives them all a fist bump. I knew that Kobe was going to do this and I was sitting just behind the scorers table, he was walking towards me now, it was only a few steps away, what the heck...

I stand up like a fucking robot, red shirt is in behind me guarding the people coming down to the floor, I shimmy past him, head over, I think my main thought was 'look like you know what you're doing'. Kobe walks towards me, I walk towards him. We are opposite the table as he begins his routine.

I probably looked sad and desperate, but who cares, I probably was sad and desperate. All the scorers raised their fists, I turned, raised mine. Kobe knocked the first, second, third, sees me, and leans over to bump. 

He could have easily ruined me, said some excuse not to, ignore me, or worse kick me out for trying. But nope. He's Kobe. He gave me a fist bump. I haven't washed the hand since.","My Kobe Story, thought I'd share...",KobeBryant24,"My Kobe Story, thought I'd share... My brother lucked into a single ticket for a Lakers game, last minute.

"The Black Mamba will be honored at Dodger Stadium, the Dodgers' blue heaven. The Los Angeles Dodgers have announced that they will be giving away Kobe Bryant-themed baseball jerseys as part of their Lakers Night promotion.

Bryant's No. 8 on the front and No. 24 on the back of the black baseball-style uniforms feature the Dodgers' traditional script logo across the chest. The material is printed to look like snake skin scales, similar to the commemorative jerseys worn by the Los Angeles Lakers in Bryant's honor during the NBA bubble.

Bryant, who tragically passed away in a helicopter crash in 2020 along with his daughter Gianna and seven others, embraced the Dodgers as his team. During the 2009 National League Championship Series between the Dodgers and his hometown Philadelphia Phillies, he even wore a blue Dodgers hat to the ballpark.

In various instances, Bryant showed his support for the Dodgers. He announced their starting lineup before Game 4 of the 2018 World Series against the Boston Red Sox. In 2013, he was a guest of former Dodgers manager Tommy Lasorda in his field box, and in 2000, after winning his first championship with the Lakers, he threw out a commemorative first pitch.

To honor[Bryant's legacy](https://www.toodat.com/community/TheLosAnge/Sports/O3GWpmbkJJazJn4K), the Dodgers will distribute black Bryant jerseys with Lakers gold trim and accents to fans who purchase their entry through a special event ticket package on the team's website. This distribution will take place when the Dodgers host the Atlanta Braves on Sept. 1.

While the Dodgers have previously held Lakers Night on Aug. 24 to pay tribute to Bryant's two uniform numbers, they won't be able to do so this year as they will be on the road facing the Cleveland Guardians on that date next month.",The Los Angeles Dodgers will be giving away Kobe Bryant jerseys.,KobeBryant24,"The Los Angeles Dodgers will be giving away Kobe Bryant jerseys.

"I‚Äôm sure that I‚Äôm not alone when I say that watching Kobe highlights, speeches, and interviews is extremely motivating. At one point, I found a Kobe speech online and set that as my morning alarm every morning.

But it was the same general speech every morning, and eventually it got old. So I decided to make my own AI voice alarm app that uses AI (think ChatGPT) and text to speech to generate unique, tailored messages that wake me up. This makes it so that your alarm knows your name, what you want to wake up to, the time, the day, your schedule, the weather, and incorporates all of these elements into your alarm. You can even prompt it with special requests like: ‚Äútell me a story from one of your games‚Äù or ‚Äúgive me motivation for my morning workout.‚Äù

I used it myself for a while and loved it. The voices sound super lifelike and the messages are phenomenal. I began sharing it with my friends and family, who thought the idea was brilliant and urged me to publicize it. So I decided to submit the app to the app store so that anyone could use it!

So the AI Tools that I used for the app aren‚Äôt free. I‚Äôm taking the hit on the default quality voices, so you can use those 100% free of charge :) 

Unfortunately, the really high quality voices that I‚Äôm using (like David Goggins, Morgan Freeman, and Kobe) are behind a paywall. I really hate to do this because I feel like these alarms could really make a lot of peoples‚Äô mornings better, but without it, I‚Äôd be at risk to get absolutely flooded with API bills. If you‚Äôre in a circumstance where you can‚Äôt pay, please PM me and I‚Äôll do my best to help you out.
