Cell and Molecular Biology, PhD Overview Requirements The Department of Cell and Molecular Biology offers a Doctor of Philosophy degree. The active research opportunities in the department are mostly concentrated in two fields, developmental biology and neuroscience. Over the course of their first two years, students will take classes aligned with their backgrounds and interests, attend seminars, and serve as teaching assistants. In their first year of the doctoral program specifically, students are expected to rotate through labs within the department and join a lab in which they will continue their dissertation research. Typically, students complete a prospectus in the third year and complete a dissertation in the fifth year. Students will complete 48 credit hours of course work with at least a 3.0 GPA (FIRM). Credit hours should be complete by the end of second year (4th semester). Core required courses include: Cell Biology CELL 6750, CMB Doctoral Seminar CELL 7870, Advanced Molecular Biology (CELL 6440), and a journal club course (NSCI 6040 or CELL 6840).
