CENG 4140Electrochemistry(3)This course will cover the fundamentals of electrochemistry followed by more detailed consideration of the thermodynamics and kinetics involved in electrochemical deposition processes. Faradaic and non-faradaic processes at electrode/electrolyte interfaces will be covered in addition to electrochemical methods used to characterize such interfaces. The course will include reviewing research papers followed by class discussions. Towards the end of the course, the use of electrochemistry in sensor applications will be covered. The graduate equivalent of this course isCENG 6140.Prerequisite(s):CHEM 1080,PHYS 1320andMATH 2210.
