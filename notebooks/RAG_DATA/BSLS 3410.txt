BSLS 3410Human Resource Training & Development(3)Students will identify the elements of human resource training and development, including
conducting a training needs assessment, implementing and evaluating training, calculating the return on investment; and linking performance and career development needs to employee training. In the process, students will formulate methods for assessing an organization; applying the ADDIE model ( assessment, design, development, implementation, and evaluation); comparing learning styles; performing needs assessments and SWOT analyses; and linking organizational strategy with training and development strategies to establish the training program as another tool for competitive advantage. This online course includes 2-4 synchronous video conferences, the scheduling of which will be confirmed during the first week of classes, with recordings available for students who are unable to attend.  This course will not satisfy requirements toward majors in the School of Liberal Arts or the A.B. Freeman School of Business.
