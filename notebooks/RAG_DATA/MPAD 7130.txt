MPAD 7130Leading Learning(3)The course examines leading learning as a system-level task. Focus areas include the instructional core and the centrality of the instructional task as predictive of student learning; current models of learning; challenges of improving instruction, effective management of learning systems; developing, enacting, and scaling vision for learning; and the role of evidence in decisions about practice and policy impacting learning. In addition, the course addresses the roles of the leader’s identity and previous learning experiences, as well as their implications for equity and leadership. Throughout the course, students will examine current systems of learning through classroom observations, interviews with leaders in the field and case studies. What does great learning look like, and how do we create equitable systems that support and demand high-quality learning experiences and outcomes for all?
