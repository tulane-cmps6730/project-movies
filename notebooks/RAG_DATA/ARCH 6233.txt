ARCH 6233Energy Modeling(3)The application of building modeling using computer simulation tools plays an integral role in the design and evaluation of energy efficient and sustainable buildings.  Architects use these simulation to understand and assess building performance at various stages of the design process. A basic understanding of energy systems, and the ability to design and manipulate them, will be especially important as we move into a future where climate change has become a reality, and environmental regulations on the built environment will tighten.
