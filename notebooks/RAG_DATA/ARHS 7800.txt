ARHS 7800Canon in Crisis: Challenging the Tenets of Art Theory(3)This seminar engages with core themes and concepts of art theory and critique as they are applied in art and visual culture. Through class discussions and end-of-term presentations, we will explore the ways in which contemporary artists are contributing to or cultivating their own discourses. Our goal is to debate the arguments presented by philosophers, curators, and artists to develop our understanding of these theoretical tools such that we gain confidence in our ability to scrutinize contemporary artistic practices, the connectivity and conversations with art of the past, and the relationship with our own artistic practice.
