BMEN 6800BME Data Science: Medical Imaging/Machine Learning(3)The objective of this course is to teach graduate students the concepts, algorithms and programming of image processing and machine learning techniques and apply them to address real world biomedical imaging challenges. The basic image processing techniques such as image geometric transforms, Fourier analysis and linear systems theory will be introduced to model and process biomedical images. In addition, we will study some machine learning approaches such as feature extraction and classification for the analysis of biomedical image data.  Finally, students will learn how to use MATLAB as a tool and apply the image processing and machine learning techniques to solve some medical imaging problems such as image enhancement, segmentation and classification.
