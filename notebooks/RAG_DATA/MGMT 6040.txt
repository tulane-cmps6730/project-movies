MGMT 6040Business Ethics & Leadership(3)This course concerns the ethical foundations of leadership in business and society. Students will gain an understanding of various academic perspectives on leadership, real-world examples of effective and ineffective leadership, and insights into their own leadership capabilities. The emphasis on ethics will include some moral philosophy, but will also involve the application of common sense morality to business leadership. This means that active student participation is essential in this course. The classroom experience will include much conversation, debate, disagreement, and dissent in response to provocative case studies, class exercises, and group projects.
