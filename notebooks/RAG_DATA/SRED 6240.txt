SRED 6240Applied Urban Economics(3)This class will focus on applied urban economics; particularly, we explore how private and public investment decisions take place within the opportunities and constraints of real estate markets.
Through readings, lectures, site visits, class discussions and professional exercises/assignments, the class will operate at the intersection of the economics of site-specific transactions (real estate development) with the economics of city-regions (economic development). In doing so, this course will situate the study urban
economics in a broader ‘city-making’ context which looks comprehensively at processes that underlie the growth, decline and regeneration of cities such as economic development, real estate development,planning, design, and public policy.
The class will use New Orleans and Los Angeles as primary ‘urban laboratories’ but will also include in-depth investigations of applied urban economic issues in other U.S. cities to provide students with comparative examples and a range of economic conditions.
