SCEN 1030Introduction to Creative Coding for the Web(3)The internet is all around us and coding for it has never been easier and more accessible thanks to open source and free software. In this introductory course (no prior coding experience necessary), students will learn how to code for the web using p5.js (a Javascript library) to create interactive and fun applications. Along with the students' own designs, we will be looking at artists, designers and online communities who have been making experimental works with code over the last 50 years. Students will leave this course with a basic to intermediate understanding of coding structure, logic and syntax in addition to a final project.

Open to high school students only.
