EENS 6840Earth & Planetary Geophysics(3)The interior structure, composition, and dynamics of Earth and the terrestrial planets can be deduced from a number of different physical, chemical, and thermodynamic observations and models. Topics include: Early bombardment and formation of proto-planetary discs, core formation, Earth's composition and age from radioactivity and thermal considerations, thermal and density structure, geomagnetic dynamo, mantle convection, and plate tectonics, and their absence on other terrestrial planets. Special topics for in-class seminars will explore the methodologies used to determine the internal structure (e.g., seismology, gravity), and the dynamics of systems (e.g., geomagnetism, plate tectonics, the water and carbon cycle). Assessment: 2 in-class quizzes, 5 problem sets, 2 class presentations, and a final critical review of 2 linked research papers on a special topic to be assigned in class.
