Movement Practice (MP) is participation in either existing dance technique classes offered by the department or in existing individual movement practices. CP consists of advanced assignments taught by various dance faculty members, undergraduate student projects, and/or guest artist projects. For MP if students participate in technique classes offered by the department, these classes are combined with undergraduate students. Graduate students are expected to participate in the entire semester of the classes with 
advanced engagement with class materials. Graduate students, as returning professionals with existing individual movement practice, may elect to continue that practice. This course is core for IDP MFA. Required 5 of 6 semesters and repeatable up to 6 times.Course Limit:6
