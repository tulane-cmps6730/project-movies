AGST 6200Advanced Research Methods and Design(3)In this course, students will be introduced to the strengths and limitations of various research techniques using examples based on psychological research. During the semester, we will cover methodologies used in basic, applied, and clinical research contexts.AGST 6300Brain and Behavior: Structure, Physiology, and Cognition in Adult and Aging Brains(3)This course is an introduction to the relations between the brain and behavior with particular emphasis on cognition and changes with aging. It is intended to be an overview and to prepare students to be knowledgeable about the neurobiology and changes associated with aging. After taking this course, students should have a basic understanding of a) the structure and function of nervous systems, b) the mechanisms of sensory input and motor output, c) the neurobiology underlying important higher cognitive functions such as emotion, learning and memory, language and executive function, and 4) neurodegeneration and the use of tools to assess cognitive decline.AGST 7020Interdisciplinary Seminar on Aging I(3)This course is the first in a two-part, team-taught seminar series designed to introduce students to the behavioral, biological, cognitive, physiological, and societal impact of aging. In particular, presenters in this course will focus on the interactive relationships between common and diverse disciplines. Special emphasis will be given to integrating knowledge and practices from across the academic community into a research approach that will serve to expand the general understanding of aging but also translate into applied practices or technologies. This course will also discuss what it means to become older within a community, what a person can expect during the aging process, and what kind of control an older person has over their aging body.AGST 7040Interdisciplinary Seminar on Aging II(3)This course is the continuation of a two-part seminar series designed to introduce students to the behavioral, biological, cognitive, physiological, and societal changes associated with aging.
