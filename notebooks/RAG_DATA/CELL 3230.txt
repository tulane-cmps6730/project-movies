CELL 3230Virology(3)In the virology lecture course you will learn about the structural and reproductive cycles for the major classes of viruses. You will gain an understanding of the structural and genetic factors involved in the virus-host cell interaction. You will also learn about the techniques used to study viruses. You will be using all this knowledge to identify new viruses, solve case studies, hypothesize how specific features of viruses evolved, and propose experiments to study the virus life cycle.Prerequisite(s):CELL 2050orEBIO 2070.
