PMBA 7320Portfolio Theory(2)This course is concerned with the choice of investment strategies with differing risk/return characteristics in the presence of uncertainty. It begins with a rigorous development of the foundations of modern portfolio theory while critically examining the assumptions that lead to its conclusions. Students will learn how various market indexes are determined, explore the pros and cons of market efficiency, and learn some of the founding principles of behavioral finance. Students will create mean/variance efficient portfolios; discuss the challenges of doing so using historical data, and develop several tools to measure the risk-adjusted performance of a portfolio.
