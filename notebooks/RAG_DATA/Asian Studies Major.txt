Asian Studies Major Overview Requirements Asian Studies draws from a broad range of courses in the liberal arts, including anthropology, art history, communication, English, film, history, philosophy, political science, and sociology. Ten courses (minimum of 30 credits) are required for the major.  Students should demonstrate elementary proficiency or the equivalent of the first year of instruction in Chinese (Mandarin), Japanese, or another Asian language in consultation with the Director of the Program. They are also expected to demonstrate an ability to locate, evaluate, and use research materials relevant to Asian Studies as evidenced by an upper level seminar. Finally, students should demonstrate breadth by taking at least one elective course concerning the East Asian region (i.e. China, Korea, or Japan), and at least one elective course outside of that region – for example, a class on Vietnam or Malaysia. Please consult the online schedule of classes for courses approved for credit in Asian Studies in a given semester. Students can also contact the Director of the Program for more information. Ten courses (minimum of 30 credits) are required for the major.
