Chemistry Minor Overview Requirements A minor in chemistry consists of CHEM 1070 General Chemistry I (3 c.h.) / CHEM 1075 General Chemistry Lab I (1 c.h.) and CHEM 1080 General Chemistry II (3 c.h.) / CHEM 1085 General Chemistry Lab II (1 c.h.) plus four additional Chemistry Department lecture courses that count toward the chemistry major. Only one semester of research (CHEM 4010, 3 c.h.) may be counted towards the minor. For students whose major requires Chemistry 1070/1075 and Chemistry 1080/1085, at least one of the additional courses must not be required by that major. Because of the interdisciplinary nature of the biological chemistry major, students in that program may not minor in chemistry.
