BMEN 6420Transport in Cells and Organs(3)Open only to graduate students. Fundamental principles of fluid mechanics and mass transport will be applied to biological systems at the cellular, tissue, and organ levels.  The topics of this course will be the cardiovascular and respiratory systems; and cell adhesion and migration, intracellular, transmembrane and transvascular transport: drug transport and pharmacokinetics, and transport-related pathophysiological conditions (inflammation, atherosclerosis, thrombosis, sickle cell disease, cancer metastasis). The lab sessions will provide training in measurement and analysis of cell transport in parallel-plate flow systems.
