PRES 6041Preservation Studio I(6)This studio is the beginning orientation course that examines all aspects of preservation concerns related to the individual building or group of buildings. The student will learn how to analyze the condition of the building(s) and its (their) context. The studio will examine the differences between building stabilization, adaptive reuse, renovation and restoration. A travel and research component will use real life experiences to illustrate the interdisciplinary nature of preservation in the Americas. An internship in an area of personal choice (such as house museum, community action organization, governmental agency, heritage education or community renewal program) will be developed during this studio.
