Future leaders in medicine must excel as clinicians as well as managers in the complex and rapidly evolving environment that now dominates healthcare. A growing number of medical students and physicians are complementing their medical education with MBA degrees. Holders of both degrees can operate their clinics more effectively, run a healthcare organization, manage a research project, or advocate for their patients and work to fix the healthcare system. The School of Medicine is partnering with the internationally-recognized A. B. Freeman School of Business to offer medical students two options for completing a joint MD/MBA program. These options allow students to earn both degrees more rapidly than when done separately. Three additional options are available for those who have already completed the medical degree. MBA Overview In the MBA program, required courses teach business fundamentals including finance, management, operations, accounting, statistics, and marketing. Elective courses allow students to focus their professional or personal interests in areas such as strategic management and innovation, analytics, real estate, and entrepreneurship. Students develop the ability to analyze opportunities for and likelihood of success of organizations operating in various environments. 4-Year Program for Newly-Admitted MD Students In the accelerated business curriculum of the four-year program, students take courses at the Freeman School of Business in the summer prior to and the summer following the first year of medical school. Students then complete their business education throughout the remainder of their time at the medical school. Participants take some courses together with Freeman students in the part-time, Professional MBA (PMBA) program, benefiting from their work experience and the opportunity to collaborate on projects with non-clinicians. Students apply to the MBA program upon acceptance to the medical school.
