MKTG 4170Mktg Planning & Implementation(3)This course focuses on the development of dynamic marketing plans for a broad array of companies who may be facing accelerated growth opportunities and/or operating difficulties. Focus will be on choosing the right marketing vehicles, determining how the vehicles need to work together, developing the implementation work plan, mapping out sequencing, and defining metrics and measurement process. Student teams will draw on this information, as well as knowledge acquired from earlier marketing courses, to implement a field study. For classroom discussions, we will be using a mix of text, articles and case studies focusing on companies across diverse industries. Fieldwork will also be discussed in class, culminating in team marketing plan presentations.
