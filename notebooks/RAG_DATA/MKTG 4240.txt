MKTG 4240Relationship Marketing(3)In marketing, nothing is as critical as building and maintaining relationships with key constituencies. Business corporations and non-profit institutions alike realize the importance of long-lasting relationships and their impact on these organizations’ success. The major objectives of this course are twofold. First, it will focus on the marketing tools and techniques that organizations use to identify key constituencies, build relationships and assess their impact on the organizations’ performance. Second, the course will provide students with a forum for presenting and defending their recommendations, and for critically examining and discussing the recommendations of others.
