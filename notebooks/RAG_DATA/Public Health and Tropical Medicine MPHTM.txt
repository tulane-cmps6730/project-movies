Public Health and Tropical Medicine, MPHTM Overview Requirements The Master of Public Health and Tropical Medicine (MPHTM) is a public health degree with a specialty in infectious diseases, and especially those diseases found in tropical regions. The program prepares public health practitioners to plan and evaluate disease control and prevention programs, physicians to better treat and evaluate tropical diseases, or students to pursue medical school and other medical professions. The curriculum consists of foundational public health courses and specialty courses in the biological, medical, social, and epidemiological aspects of diseases that are more prevalent in tropical regions. Physicians, medical students, and healthcare professionals can also complete the requirements for the Diploma Course in Clinical Tropical Medicine to  be eligible for the Certification Examination in Clinical Tropical Medicine and Traveler’s Health (CTropMed®) offered by the American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (ASTMH). Program Competencies Assess key elements affecting the pathogenesis and transmission of infectious diseases commonly found in the tropics. Assess the factors influencing tropical disease prevention, control and diagnosis. Identify appropriate techniques, as they relate to specific tropical disease pathogen and vector for diagnosis, prevention, and control. Critique relevant methods for planning and evaluating tropical disease control and prevention programs.

Option for students in the joint MD/MPHTM only Students concurrently enrolled in the Tulane University School of Medicine and earning the joint MD/MPHTM degree have the option of substituting TRMD 7960 (Clinical Tropical Medicine ) and TRMD 6340 (Diagnostic Methods in Microbiology) in place of TRMD 6420 (Tropical Virology) and TRMD 6060 (Medical Entomology). These substitutions permit joint MD/MPHTM students to also complete the requirements for the Diploma Course in Clinical Tropical Medicine from the American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (ASTMH) upon graduation. Recommended coursework for Clinicians, Medical Students and Healthcare Professionals (Diploma Course in Clinical Tropical Medicine) Physicians and other eligible health care professionals interested in deepening their knowledge of diagnoses and treatment of tropical diseases can take two elective courses focusing on the clinical aspects of tropical diseases:  TRMD 6340 - Diagnostic Methods in Microbiology and TRMD 7960 Clinical Tropical Medicine. Students who successfully complete these courses are eligible to take the Certificate of Knowledge in Clinical Tropical Medicine and Travelers' Health (CTropMed®) Examination administered by American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (ASTMH). Students with a clinical focus are also encouraged to take Tropical Medicine Seminar (TRMD-7000) at least once.
