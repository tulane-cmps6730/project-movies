TRMD 7960Clinical Tropical Medicine(3)Clinical Tropical Medicine is designed to offer an overview of topics of clinical importance in tropical medicine, with an emphasis on a syndromic approach to patient presentation. Through a combination of lectures and clinical case presentations with group discussions the course both introduces key subject matter and will help students apply their knowledge to the clinical sphere. It is expected to complement other course offerings from the Tropical Medicine Department for the MPHTM and Diploma in Tropical Medicine curricula. Participants should have some experience in clinical medicine (usually a terminal degree in medicine, nursing, or veterinary sciences) and should either have experience or be in the process of learning about diseases of the tropics. Students, faculty and visiting professors will present clinical cases pertaining to issues in tropical medicine, wilderness medicine and travel medicine. There will be active class participation.
