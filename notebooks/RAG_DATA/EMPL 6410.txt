EMPL 6410Introduction to Contract Law and Working with Contracts(2)This course is intended to equip the non-legal business professional with skills to understand and work with written, negotiated business agreements. We will discuss fundamental principles and sources of contract law, but we will approach all aspects of the course from the practical perspective of transactional lawyers and business professionals who must work collaboratively to negotiate, draft, implement, and manage written business contracts. Students will learn how to translate business deal terms into contract provisions that achieve appropriate legal consequences and manage risk. Students will analyze different types of negotiated business agreements and provisions (with a focus on employment-related contracts) and learn contemporary commercial drafting techniques to manage risk, minimize ambiguity, and solve problems through effective drafting.Prerequisite(s):EMPLÂ 6400and6401.
