FREN 6831Writing Algeria(3)This course explores representations of trauma and processes of memorialization in postcolonial Algeria. Through a study of literary, cinematic, and cultural texts, we will examine multiple challenges to FLN-sponsored readings of national history. Starting in the years directly preceding the 1962 Independence, these texts and cultural objects produce new sites of memory running counter to official narratives of the history of colonization and the myth of the national liberation struggle.
