NSCI 6365Comparative Neuroanatomy Lab(1)This course focuses on the relevant similarities and differences of model systems in the neurosciences. Students in the laboratory will engage in an intensive comparative study of the structural and functional anatomy of commonly used living model systems. Hands-on dissections of the nervous system from various species is utilized to reinforce learning, demonstrate how the nervous system is modified to match body type and lifestyle, and to give students experience in practical skills for neuroscience research. In addition, students will pursue an independent project on a protein of their choice.  Students will use a literature search to try to map the relative expression of this protein across the nervous system.
