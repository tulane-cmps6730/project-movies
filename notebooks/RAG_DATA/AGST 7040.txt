AGST 7040Interdisciplinary Seminar on Aging II(3)This course is the continuation of a two-part seminar series designed to introduce students to the behavioral, biological, cognitive, physiological, and societal changes associated with aging. In particular, presenters in this course will focus on the interactive relationships between common and diverse disciplines. Special emphasis will be given to integrating knowledge and practices from across the academic community into a research approach that will serve to expand the general understanding of aging but also translate into applied practices or technologies. This course will also discuss what it means to become older within a community, what a person can expect during the aging process, and what kind of control an older person has over their aging body.
