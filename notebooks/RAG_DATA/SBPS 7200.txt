SBPS 7200Development Issues, Theory, & Measurement(3)This seminar reviews major theories and debates about social, human, and economic development in the developing world, especially Africa, Latin America, and South Asia. These concepts are useful to public health researchers and practitioners aiming to advance human well-being. The first 3 weeks cover economic growth, modernization, neoliberalism, sustainable development, human development/the capabilities approach, human rights, and Marxian theory/dependency schools. The second 3 weeks review critical perspectives: post-structuralism, post-colonialism, feminist theories, complexity and dynamic systems, and social innovation. Ethnographic case studies of development and global health projects reveals how assumptions and practices translate into real-life “development” projects that can fail to address key issues and cause unintended outcomes that have effects. The readings invite us to think differently about knowledge, evidence, culture, participation, globalization, and sustainability; we consider the role of foreign aid and relevant development actors.
