BMEN 6610Intro Comp Biomechanics(3)This course covers fundamentals of computational methods with the emphasis in biomechanics applications. The computational methods include finite element methods and finite difference methods at the introductory level. The course will use MATLAB to implement these methods. The underlying theories of these numerical methods will be taught, and example problems will be discussed during the lecture. Example problems will include those from implant design, bone biomechanics, soft tissue biomechanics, etc. in static and dynamic conditions. The course will also discuss some special issues such as the stability/convergence criteria and the error estimation. The student will work on a term project to exercise these issues on a biomechanics problem of his/her choice.
