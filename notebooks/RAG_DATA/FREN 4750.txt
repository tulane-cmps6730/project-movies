FREN 4750The Avant-Garde(3)The history and theory of the avant-garde, from the movements of the early 20th century to today. We will explore the art, performances, poetics and manifestos of the so-called "historic" avant-gardes of a century ago, including the well-known antics of  Dada (Zurich and Paris), Surrealist practices based first in Paris and eventually all over the world, Italian Futurism, visual arts and cinema (Cubism, etc.) and the London-based groups of writers working in Imagism and Vorticism.
