BMEN 6840Medical Imaging Physics(3)This course will introduce imaging methods in medicine, including radiography, computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), nuclear medicine (PET and SPECT), and ultrasound imaging. The basic physical principles of each imaging modality will be introduced, including the imaging energy source, properties and interaction with tissue. Basic concepts of image reconstruction will be discussed. This course will include laboratory visits to the School of Medicine Department of Radiology to explore real world uses of medical imaging systems. A course project will be assigned for students to assess new and emerging medical imaging systems.Prerequisite(s):BMENÂ 3730or6730.
