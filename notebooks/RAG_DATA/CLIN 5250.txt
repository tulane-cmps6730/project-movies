CLIN 5250Environmental Law Clinic(3)The Tulane Environmental Law Clinic (TELC) provides legal services to local, regional, and national groups, as well as individuals, on a wide range of environmental and public participation issues. Under the supervision of the Clinic’s staff attorneys, students in the Clinic take the lead in representing clients in pleadings and oral arguments before local governmental bodies, state and federal agencies, and state and federal courts. Among the issues TELC student attorneys address are issues faced by fence line environmental justice communities impacted by facilities which pollute their land, air and water and pose risks from accidental releases; Atchafalaya Basin residents and fishermen who seek to preserve their way of life and the wetlands they rely on; clients concerned with preserving fish and wildlife, including threatened and endangered species; and regional and national groups addressing local environmental issues which reverberate nationwide. TELC is open to 3Ls, 2Ls (during the spring semester only), and LLMs with JD degrees from U.S. law schools. 2L and 3L students are required to enroll for two semesters; LLMs are limited to one semester in TELC. Under student-practice rules, 3Ls and LLMs may sign pleadings and appear in court under the guidance of TELC’s supervising attorneys.
