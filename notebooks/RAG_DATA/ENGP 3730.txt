ENGP 3730Signals and Systems(3)Fundamentals of systems and signals analysis, and introduction to control systems.  Topics include Laplace and Fourier transforms, the convolution theorem, time- and space-frequency-domain systems analysis, signal analysis, signals and noise, the mathematics of imaging, and examples and applications.  The use of MATLAB and Simulink to analyze signals and systems will be reinforced.
