AGST 6300Brain and Behavior: Structure, Physiology, and Cognition in Adult and Aging Brains(3)This course is an introduction to the relations between the brain and behavior with particular emphasis on cognition and changes with aging. It is intended to be an overview and to prepare students to be knowledgeable about the neurobiology and changes associated with aging. After taking this course, students should have a basic understanding of a) the structure and function of nervous systems, b) the mechanisms of sensory input and motor output, c) the neurobiology underlying important higher cognitive functions such as emotion, learning and memory, language and executive function, and 4) neurodegeneration and the use of tools to assess cognitive decline.
