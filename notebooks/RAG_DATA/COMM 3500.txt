COMM 3500British Cultural Studies(3)This course examines British contemporary multicultural society through the field and method known as cultural studies, which also has its intellectual roots in Britain. This course will introduce students to the terms, analytical techniques, and interpretive strategies commonly employed in cultural studies. Emphasis is on interdisciplinary approaches to exploring how everyday cultural processes and cultural artifacts are produced and how meaning is shaped through contestations of race, class and gender, and national identity. Through discussion, research, and  writing, class members investigate these varied dimensions of British multiculture; learn to understand them in their broader historical, aesthetic, and political contexts.
