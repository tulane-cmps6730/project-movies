DRLS 7020Disaster Recovery & Resilience(3)The purpose of the course is to focus on the short and long-term reality of the environmental disaster facing the South Louisiana Coastal in the physical area between the mouth of the Mississippi and the Atchafalaya basin outlet. Using the tools of implementation science we will collectively segment and organize evidence to understand and chart a path to resilience for the different local populations directly impacted. Multiple pedagogical approaches including lectures, field trips, readings, interviews with local residents and outside speakers will be utilized to render the scope of the experience as inclusive as possible. The course focuses on building analytical skills and methodological tools for understanding and increasing the rate of implementation of resilience strategies for effected communities. Specific skills of implementation science will be taught which when combined with contextual knowledge of the training site will lead to the competency of being able to execute and prepare and implement a plan for assisting communities in becoming rapidly more prepared and more resilient to environmental threats. The subject will be the long term disaster of coastal degradation and global warming on the Louisiana gulf coast.
