Courses to be completed at the marine field station must be approved for transfer credit by the Marine Biology advisor before they are taken at the marine field station. Students majoring in ecology and evolutionary biology or environmental biology who minor in marine biology will complete a minimum of 16 credits beyond the departmental major.
