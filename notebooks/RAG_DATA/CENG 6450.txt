CENG 6450Applied Biochemistry I(3)Biochemistry is the study of the chemistry and chemical processes involved with the molecules that are utilized by living organisms. This two-semester series will provide an in-depth coverage of carbon- and nitrogen-containing molecules such as proteins and DNA and certain cofactors. In the first semester enzyme kinetics and catalysis will be covered, along with carbohydrates and their metabolism. The metabolic pathways and associated bioenergetics of glycolysis and the TCA cycle will be examined in detail. The material will be related to everyday life, diet, nutrition, and exercise performance.
