LGST 4160Law of E-Commerce(3)This course looks at how courts, legislatures and regulators confront the significant issues of the internet world. Billions of people are now active on social media, and firms such as Google, Facebook, Amazon and Alibaba are among the world's most valuable and influential. The legal interfaces between the physical world and the digital world are therefore increasingly important. In particular, exploitation of personal information online by governments, digital platforms and bad actors is becoming a constant source of significant controversies. The course topics include dispute resolution, cyber torts, crimes, intellectual property issues, risk management, information security and privacy issues.
