RCSE 6802Introduction to Coastal Science and Engineering(3)With approximately 3 billion people living within 200 kilometers of the worldâ€™s coastlines, coastal regions are home to a large and ever-growing population. A broad engineering knowledge is fundamental for the construction, protection, and maintenance of these coastal communities, and a good scientific understanding of the main underlying physical, chemical and ecological processes is particularly necessary considering the climatic changes we are facing in the 21st century. This course is designed to be a graduate and advanced undergraduate, interdisciplinary examination of coastal science and engineering practices that can serve as a springboard to more advanced coursework on the disciplinary
aspects covered. It will also be useful to practitioners who require an interdisciplinary overview of coastal systems to more effectively perform their professional duties.
