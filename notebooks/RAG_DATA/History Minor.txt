History Minor Overview Requirements In order to receive a history minor, students must complete six courses, including two seminars.  Students working toward a history minor are encouraged to take a range of courses but are free to pursue their own academic interests.  It is expected that by taking six history courses students will develop both research and writing skills, including working with primary and secondary sources. The History Minor consists of six courses distributed as follows: No more than one course at the 1000-level. At least one 3000-level seminar. At least one Advanced Seminar numbered 6000-6999. Courses that do not have a letter grade cannot count toward the major or minor.
