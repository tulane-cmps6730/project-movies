RCSE 6820Introduction to River-Coastal Hydrologic and Hydraulic Modeling(3)Numerical models are effective and informative research, design, and planning tools. The substantial advancement in computational power has allowed numerical models to be a viable and efficient tool to solve complex problems and improve our understanding of the fundamentals in the water resources field. Therefore, it is critical to provide an in-depth understanding of the basics of numerical modeling techniques and recognize the strengths and limitations of these techniques. This 3 credit hour graduate level introductory modeling
course will provide general overview of the basics of numerical modeling, model development, and applications. This course will also include opportunities for the students to participate in hands-on applications to examine a research, design or a planning problem and explore ways where numerical models can provide usable information to answer or provide insights into these questions.
