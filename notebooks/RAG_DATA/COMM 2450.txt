COMM 2450Topics Gender/Race/Class/Media(3)This course introduces students to the research about gender, race, and class in the media. We will cover the main concepts, theories, methods, and debates in media and communication scholarship about multiple forms of inequalities. We will explore the intersections of gender, race, and class and how different types and technologies of media (television shows, news, movies, magazines, commercials, digital media etc.) reinforce, challenge or re-shape existing power differences in society. The course explores these topics by focusing on the institutional structures of commercial media, representations, and audiences. Throughout the course, we will examine a broad range of media texts as examples.
