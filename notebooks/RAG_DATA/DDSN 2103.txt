DDSN 2103Intro to Copywriting(3)This online course introduces students to the fundamentals of advertising copywriting. Lectures, readings, and online resources explore how to begin an assignment, find a brand voice, connect with and influence an audience, and develop concise, meaningful copy for traditional and digital media. Students will work alone and in pairs to research, concept, and write ads and campaigns for mock clients and service-learning projects. They will also analyze and critique their own and others' writing through written assignments and in-class discussion. Class meets synchronously once each week.
