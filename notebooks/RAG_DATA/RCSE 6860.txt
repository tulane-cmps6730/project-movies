RCSE 6860Environmental Data Analysis in the Anthropocene(3)Scientists, engineers, and planners are increasingly faced with the challenges of a changing environment. These changes can be climate change related – and associated with factors such as sea-level rise, droughts, or heavy precipitation – or result from more local human overprints of the natural landscape (e.g., changes in land use, dredging of rivers, flood protection measures). But they all require, more than ever, tailored data analysis tools to capture transient behaviors, non-stationarity, and new equilibria. This class equips students with the probability, data, and time series analysis tools that they need to interpret a wide range of environmental data - from lab measurements to field observations.Prerequisite(s):RCSE 6800or6802.
