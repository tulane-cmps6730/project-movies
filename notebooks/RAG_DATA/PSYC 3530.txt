PSYC 3530Introduction to Health Psychology(3)The primary purpose of this course is to provide an introduction to the study of health psychology. The course will examine how biological, psychological, and social factors interact with and affect: (1) the efforts people make in promoting good health and preventing illness; (2) the treatment people receive for medical problems; (3) how effectively people cope with and reduce stress and pain; and (4) the recovery, rehabilitation, and psychosocial adjustment of patients with serious health problems. The two course goals are to: (a) develop an
understanding and appreciation of the complex interplay between one’s physical well-being and a variety of biological, psychological, and social factors; and (b) learn how psychological research methods, theories, and principles can be applied to enhance biomedical approaches for promoting health and treating illness.Prerequisite(s):PSYC 1000.
