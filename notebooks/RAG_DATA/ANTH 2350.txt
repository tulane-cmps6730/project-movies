ANTH 2350Architecture and Power in the Ancient World(3)This class will explore how political, religious, ideological and cultural ideas among the worldâ€™s earliest urban civilizations were inscribed in the landscape in the form of monumental construction. To achieve these objectives the class will study five different regions of the ancient world with the goal of evaluating how built space (buildings, monuments, and public plazas) helped develop and maintain socio-political hierarchy, i.e., "civilization".
