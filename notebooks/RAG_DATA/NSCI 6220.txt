NSCI 6220Neural Microengineering(3)In recent years, a number of technologies have been developed and utilized for probing the nervous system.  This course will focus on microscale tools, technologies, and techniques employed for the control, manipulation, and study of the nervous system in vitro.  Course material will be presented primarily by students who prepare presentations from extensive background literature review.  A number of projects will be assigned as design challenges in which multiple interdisciplinary groups will research and present proposed solutions to the same challenge.  No background in engineering or math is required. Generally offered every other Spring.
