PSYC 4090Univariate II(3)Whereas the emphasis of the prerequisite course, Univariate I, was the pairing of statistical concepts with by-hand computations, Univariate II covers more practical approaches. Specifically the course includes detailed instruction on the use of statistical software packages (IBM SPSS and R). The course covers generation of descriptive statistics as well as running a variety of analyses, including those previously done by hand in Univariate I. The course also includes instruction in additional analysis methods, including assessment of normality, multiple regression, interaction between continuous predictors in regression, and the use of coded predictors to represent categorical variables in regression. For all analyses, the course covers interpretation of software output and students are guided in preparing written communication of results. The PSYC6090 requirement for the 4+1 MS in PSYC or PSBH is waived for· students who successfully complete the 3090-4090 sequence.
