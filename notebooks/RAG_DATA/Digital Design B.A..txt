Digital Design, B.A. Overview Requirements The mission of the Tulane School of Professional Advancement Digital Design program is to bridge the gap between art and technology by providing students with superior creative problem-solving, acute visual thinking, and cultural and socially significant design challenges while using industry-relevant and forward-thinking technology. In addition to building their professional design portfolios, students will gain experiences beyond the classroom through conferences and community networking events. The Tulane School of Professional Advancement Awards the B.A. in Digital Design following the completion of 120 credits, which includes 42 credits in the major. All students in the digital design major take core courses in design foundations and then declare a career track to specialize in either Graphic Design or Interactive UX/UI Design. Blocks Each Digital Design track consists of "blocks" showing the required order of all coursework. All courses within each block must be completed before you may move on to the next block. For example, all courses in Block 1 must be completed before any courses may be taken in Block 2, and so on. Courses within a block may be take at the same time. Reviews Due to the highly demanding nature of this program, students are assessed for knowledge and preparedness for further courses after both Block 2 and Block 4. The reviews include a portfolio review and a questionnaire, both of them evaluated and scored by faculty. A score of 80 or higher constitutes passing the review, which means that the student is ready to proceed in the program. Students who do not pass may resubmit their portfolios the following semester; a letter will be provided to each student with specific recommendations for how to improve their work, which may include taking additional leveling classes .Students who fail the review twice may be asked to take a semester of leave to work on a portfolio, or to change majors.
