ARHS 6878Contested Vision Civil War II(4)In the first semester of this 2 part course (ARHSÂ 6877) we investigated a wide range of art and visual culture including painting, sculpture, photography, film, performance, and public history sites to  explore contested visions of the Civil War and related issues including slavery and abolition, Emancipation, Reconstruction and reunion, and narratives romanticizing the culture of the Old South.  This semester, you will use that foundational knowledge to work with your peers to develop an online exhibition of art and material culture that engages these concerns.
