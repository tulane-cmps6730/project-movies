CLAS 2320Ancient Greek Religion(3)What was the ancient Greek religion about? And how can we know about the religious experience of a population that is long gone? Both these questions are interconnected and represent the core of this course. Week after week, we will reconstruct the principles and articulation of religious beliefs and practice in ancient Greece, reflecting on the evidence we can use. We will discover the ways that religious system mirrors a specific understanding of human society and its place in the universe. And, with it, we will find that, surprisingly or not, that religious system provided a solid base to several modern religious practices.
