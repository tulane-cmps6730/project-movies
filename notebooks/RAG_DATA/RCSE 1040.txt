RCSE 1040The Gulf Coast in 2100: Sustaining Healthy Ecosystems and Vibrant Community(3)In the 21st century, Gulf Coast ecosystems, communities and economies are under unprecedented threat from the effects of a rapidly changing climate, compounded by pre-existing human and natural factors. This seminar-based course will use a diverse team of instructors and guest discussion leaders to outline the issues and challenges that are underway in the Gulf, and to explore solutions. A second goal will be to explore possible career and advocacy pathways for students to contribute to “Saving the Gulf Coast”.
