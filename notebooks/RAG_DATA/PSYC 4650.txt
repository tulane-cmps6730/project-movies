PSYC 4650Cognitive Development(3)In addition  to describing developmental and individual differences in cognition, scientists who study children's thinking are concerned with the mechanisms that underlie cognition and its development. How do biological factor interact with experiences in the physical and social world to yield a particular pattern of development? Do children develop all their intellectual skills uniformly, or do some skills develop at a faster rate than others? Is development relatively continuous and gradual over a childhood, or are there major disruptions on its course? We will examine classic and contemporary accounts of cognitive development, and consider them from both a theoretical and an empirical standpoint.
