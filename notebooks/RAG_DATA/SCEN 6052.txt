SCEN 6052Career Development and Global Citizenship Workshops(0)The Career Development & Global Citizenship workshop course is a two-part workshop series designed to help graduate students gain skills they need for their professional career after they complete their studies.

The Career Development portion of the workshop will last the first 6 weeks of the semester. The workshop is designed to help graduate students gain awareness of the work culture in the United States, advance professionally, make smart career decisions, and find future career opportunities.

The Global Citizenship portion of the workshop will last the remaining 8 weeks of the semester. This course introduces global citizenship as a lens through which students examine various aspects of life in the complex, globalized world of the 21st century, explore the unique challenges of our time and the forces that shape them, and consider how they can take action to improve conditions locally and/or globally. In doing so, it follows the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), which proposes global citizenship as a way of framing the exploration of global issues and challenges, with the aim of helping students develop the attitudes, knowledge, and skills necessary to secure a more just, peaceful, tolerant, inclusive, secure and sustainable world. Students will learn how cultural and social identity, bias, discrimination, and inequality shape perspectives, including their own, and explore cultural diversity and the challenges of intercultural communication.

Students who successfully complete this course receive a Global Citizenship certificate endorsed by the University for Peace, a U.N. Charter institution in Costa Rica.Prerequisite(s):SCENÂ 6050.Maximum Hours:99
