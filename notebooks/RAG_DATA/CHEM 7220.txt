CHEM 7220Inorganic Reaction Mechanics(3)The course discusses the primary reactions of transition metal, organometallic and main group compounds.  Concepts of chemical kinetics are applied to inorganic substitution, isomerization, oxidation/reduction, catalysis and photochemistry. The theoretical framework associated with electron and atom transfer reactions is also presented.
