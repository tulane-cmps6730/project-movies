EENS 6191Earth Materials Lab(0)In this course you will investigate the materials that comprise the Earth and how they are made. You will learn about mineral structure and chemistry and be able to relate these parameters to the physical properties of minerals. An analysis of phase stability will follow that will build towards interpreting phase diagrams. These new skills will be applied to understanding the formation of igneous and metamorphic rocks of Earth as organized by tectonic setting.
