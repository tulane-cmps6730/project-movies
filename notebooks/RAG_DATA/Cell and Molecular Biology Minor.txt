Cell and Molecular Biology Minor Overview Requirements The minor in Cell and Molecular Biology introduces the mechanistic study of the life of the cell at the molecular level. Due to the extensive overlap in curricula, Biological Chemistry majors cannot minor in Cell and Molecular Biology. Neuroscience majors may minor in Cell and Molecular Biology, but the requirements are more rigorous. Students wishing to minor in cell and molecular biology must complete: Course List Course ID Title Credits Required Courses CELL 1010 Intro to Cell & Molec Biology 3 CELL 2050 Genetics 3 CELL 3030 Molecular Biology 3 CELL 3750 Cell Biology 3 Additional Coursework Select two electives in biology 6 Select 16 credits in chemistry 1 16 Total Credit Hours 34 1 One year of both general and organic chemistry and their respective laboratories Because of the interdisciplinary nature of the biological chemistry major, students in that program may not minor in cell and molecular biology.
