TIDR 1983Us vs. Them(1)Black vs. White. Citizen vs. Immigrant. Transgender vs. Cisgender. Christian vs. Muslim. Gay vs. Straight. The list goes on. In recent years, the United States has become increasingly polarized. The most interesting and exciting aspects of human diversity are set against one another, in rigid opposing binaries. Through interactive workshops, cultural trips, discussions of texts and films, writing reflections, and guest speakers, this seminar will serve as an incubator for students from diverse backgrounds to develop their understanding of the complexities of cultures, identities, and power dynamics. We will simultaneously explore everyday practices for world building beyond "Us. Vs. Them."
