RCSE 6710Open Channel Flow(3)This course covers the principles of open channel hydraulics, and their applications for analysis and design of river channels. Specifically, the course covers open channels classifications and properties, computation of uniform flow, steady gradually varied flow, flow over hydraulic structures (spillways, weirs, gates, culverts, syphons, and pumps), hydraulic jump, flow characteristics in meandering rivers and nonprismatic channels, and unsteady flow. Pre-requisite: Permission of instructor.
