Russian Major Overview Requirements Russian Studies Major The Russian Major is housed in our Department and is designed to provide students with the necessary skills to communicate effectively in Russian both orally and in writing. The Russian program also seeks to familiarize students with influential literary, critical, and cinematographic works in Russian, studied within their cultural and historical context. Furthermore, the program introduces students to various ethnicities, their histories and roles in shaping today’s Russia. Finally, it provides them with an understanding of key social and political trends and challenges defining the Soviet and the post-Soviet era. The Russian major requires 27 credits (nine courses) beyond Russian 2030. Courses taught in English, such as Tolstoy and Dostoevsky or courses on Russian art, count toward the major. Students may also petition for permission to use two courses outside the department (e.g. in Russian history or Russian politics) toward the major. The department generally accepts transfer credit toward the major from summer and semester study at accredited U.S. and Russian universities. No more than four courses can be counted toward major if the student spends an entire year abroad, and no more than 3 courses for one semester abroad.
