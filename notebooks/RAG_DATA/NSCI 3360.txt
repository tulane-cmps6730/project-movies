NSCI 3360Neuroanatomy & CNS Dissection(3)The course emphasis is extracting intact Central Nervous System (CNS) structures with connecting peripheral nerves. The course will look at specific pathways (afferent, efferent, dermatomes) and discuss related clinical manifestations associated with lesions to the individual CNS and peripheral nerve structures. Team dissection will attempt to save substantial segments of cranial nerves and will explore the structures with which they communicate. As student progress through the dissection they will: 1) identify structures that surround and or cover the CNS; 2) log them in a course notebook and then dissect appropriate structures. Grading will be based upon participation, complete notebooks and final dissection results. (e.g., did you remove the brain, spinal cord, and peripheral nerves as a single unit in reasonable condition?)
