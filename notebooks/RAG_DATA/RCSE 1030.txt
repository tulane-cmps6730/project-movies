RCSE 1030Climate Change and Global Rivers(3)This course covers the basic principles of global climate change, global change and the management of water resources above and below ground. The course will begin with a review of the IPCC Climate Change 2022: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability Summary for Policy Makers and selected readings covering concepts in the UN Sustainable Targets Network draft methodology for corporate water sustainability. From here we will survey large river systems in a compare/contrast modality using the IPCC, UNSDG and SBTN-W frameworks as a lens through which to see future pathways. We will spend the first several weeks in the US on the Colorado and Mississippi River basins. From here we will explore global basins (one per week) including: the Mekong, Amazon, Ganges-Indus, Yellow-Yangtze and the Congo. The course will deliver introductory skills in collaboration, science communication, systems thinking and synthesis, and science diplomacy.
