Anatomy, MS Overview Requirements The MS Anatomy degree is structured for those who wish to enhance their eligibility for entry to professional schools. This is a 1-year non-thesis program of study of cadaveric dissection-based gross anatomy, embryology, cell biology and histology, and neuroscience leading to a Master of Science degree in Anatomy. It is designed specifically for candidates who plan to attend medical school, or dental school, or enroll in other professional or advanced degree programs; it serves to improve credentials to compete for admission to a medical or dental school. The degree program offers a carefully designed curriculum that includes taking classes with medical students, participating in a learning experience that closely models the medical school environment (small group teaching and learning, problem-based learning, team-based learning, simulation, virtual microscopy, dissection-based anatomy). A small class size is maintained for students to maximize the small-group teaching environment. Students in the MS program take anatomy and histology courses alongside first year medical students at Tulane Medical School. All other graduate courses are taught within the School of Medicine by full time Medical School faculty. Students must take 32 credit hours of course work during the fall and spring semesters and complete the requirements for the degree.
