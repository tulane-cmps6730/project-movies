EBIO 6110Tropical Ecology and Agriculture(3)Through lectures and discussion, we develop a sound background in modern tropical ecology and agriculture, including conservation. This background will include knowledge of how scientists come to reach understanding about tropical ecosystems by using natural history/observational studies, experiments and models/theory. Finally, we will develop the analytical tools that are needed to continue learning about and acting on behalf of tropical ecosystems and/or other environmental issues of importance.
