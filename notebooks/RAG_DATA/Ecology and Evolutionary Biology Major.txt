Ecology and Evolutionary Biology Major Overview Requirements The major in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology is an innovative program of study. Our diverse faculty offer engaging, student-centered courses with ample opportunities for hands-on learning in the lab and field in addition to research and study abroad programming in Ecuador, Australia, and Scandinavia, for example. Students are encouraged to join our labs, where they can develop a wide range of skills and expertise in areas including molecular and microbiology, physiology, animal behavior, and disease and field ecology. The EBIO major prepares students for careers in zoology, botany, conservation, science education, consulting, non-governmental organizations, as well as graduate and professional programs. Students interested in pursuing advanced study in public health, medical or veterinary school also benefit from the breadth and depth of the major, and the unique extent of faculty-student engagement. The Ecology and Evolutionary Biology Department also offers a major in Environmental Biology and a minor in Marine Biology to undergraduate students. The major in ecology and evolutionary biology provides understanding of the structure and function of organisms and their evolution and ecology. Majors must complete six core courses, five elective courses, and the capstone requirement.

Any two Mathematics courses (MATH) numbered 1210 and above may be used to satisfy this requirement. However, the combination of MATH 1150 and MATH 1160 (Long Calculus) may only count as one course towards this requirement. 2 Five elective courses(see department courses listing) are selected according to the interests of the student in consultation with the major advisor. Two of the electives must be designated laboratory or field courses. In addition, a student may use a maximum of one course from an approved list of courses (see below) from other departments as an elective course. Courses representing internship studies, independent studies, and seminars may not count as elective courses. 3 This capstone requirement may be satisfied by completion of EBIO 5970 Capstone Research Seminars (3 c.h.) or EBIO 5971 Capstone Research Seminars (2 c.h.) . 4 The option of CELL 2050+EBIO 2072 is available only to double majors and/or pre-health students whose outside program otherwise require CELL 2050. Note(s): Additional courses in biological statistics and physics are also highly recommended. Extradepartmental Courses Any one of these courses, which are not taught by the faculty of the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, is acceptable as one of the electives in the required programs for the EE Biology  or the Environmental Biology major if not already required by that major.
