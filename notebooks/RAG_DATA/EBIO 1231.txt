EBIO 1231Exploring Animal Behavior(3)The goal of this course is to provide an introduction to animal behavior.  The course will begin with an introduction to the application of the scientific method to the study of behavior.  Topics that will follow include the ontogeny(development) of behavior, neuronal and hormonal control of behavior, migration, communication, reproductive behavior, mating systems, parental care, and the evolution of social behavior.  It will involve both a lecture component as well as a hands-on laboratory component in which students will engage in activities to observe the concepts in action.  This class is only open to high school students who are participating in the Tulane Science Scholars Program (TSSP).  For students who pass this course with a B or higher and choose to enroll at Tulane University, this course can be applied towards three hours of general elective credit.  These credits will not count towards any of the Ecology and Evolutionary Biology Department majors.
