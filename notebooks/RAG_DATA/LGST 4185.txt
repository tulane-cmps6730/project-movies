LGST 4185White Collar Crime II(3)This course builds on concepts introduced in White Collar Crime I (LGST 4175-01), although that course is not a prerequisite. As discussed in White Collar Crime I, white collar crime is a significant problem in the business world. Whether you plan to pursue a career in business or in law, you should be familiar with concepts such as corporate criminal liability and the reasons why otherwise successful business people commit crimes. This course analyzes these important concepts by focusing on high-profile and noteworthy white collar crime cases. Many of these cases went to trial. Others ended in guilty pleas or dismissals but nevertheless involved extensive litigation. After analyzing these cases, you will have a better understanding of the issues prevalent in white collar prosecutions.
