HPAM 7460Managerial Economics for Public Health Leaders(3)This managerial economics course bridges and integrates basic economic and financial management concepts with practical application to improve problem-solving skills and inform effective leadership decision-making in dynamic public health and healthcare organizations. Students apply financial management analysis tools and techniques (e.g., forecasting, budgeting, time value analysis, risk analysis) through the lens of common economic principles, including scarcity and choice, risk and uncertainty, demand and supply, and incentives. The emphasis within a market-based economy considers stakeholders (e.g., public, patients, providers, policymakers) and market imperfections, such as third-party payers, regulation, principal-agent relationship, and externalities in a global context.
