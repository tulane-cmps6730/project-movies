CMPS 6100Introduction to Computer Science(3)This course is a graduate level introduction to computer science. Not assuming a background in computer science, it introduces programming fundamentals such as modular design, recursion, and object-oriented programming, key ideas from algorithms and analysis including algorithm design, computational complexity, and parallelism, fundamental data structures, crucial concepts from operating systems, and the organization and design of computer networks. Students in this course will establish a broad foundation for the future study and exploration of computer science. This is a stand-along graduate introductory computer science course that does not count towards any graduate program in computer science.
