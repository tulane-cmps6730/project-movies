Digital Design, Post-Baccalaureate Certificate Overview Requirements The Digital Design Post-Baccalaureate Certificate (PBC) is designed for individuals who have already earned a Bachelor's degree. Both PBCs align with the two tracks within the Digital Design program; Graphic Design and Interactive UX/UI Design. These certificates are comprised of all of the coursework required for an undergraduate major, without required courses in other subjects. Matriculation Blocks The blocks show the order in which coursework must be taken. All courses within each block must be completed before you may move on to the next block. For example, all courses in Block 1 must be completed before any courses may be taken in Block 2, and so on. Courses within a block may be taken at the same time. Lower-Level and Upper-Level Reviews Due to the highly competitive nature of this degree plan, students will be assessed after Block 2 and Block 3 are completed. The purpose of these reviews is to certify that students are ready to proceed on to further coursework. Each review will consist of a portfolio and questionnaire to be evaluated and scored by faculty. A score of 80 or higher constitutes passing the review. Students who do not pass may resubmit the review the following semester; a letter detailing recommendations will be provided to each student who has not passed. Students who fail a review twice may be asked to take a semester of leave to work on a portfolio or to change majors.
