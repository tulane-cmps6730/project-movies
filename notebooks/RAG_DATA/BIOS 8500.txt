BIOS 8500Monte Carlo and Bootstrapping(3)This hands-on course introduces the methods used for Monte Carlo simulations and nonparametric bootstrapping. Students learn how to design, program, and interpret a simulation study, uses of bootstrapping for estimation and inference, jackknifing, and other resampling methods. Monte Carlo Markov Chain methods and Bayesian inference in Monte Carlo methods will be introduced. This is an advanced, computer-intensive course, so knowledge of programming language (SAS or R preferred) as well as ability to work independently are required.Prerequisite(s):(BIOSÂ 7060,7080,7150,7220or7300).
