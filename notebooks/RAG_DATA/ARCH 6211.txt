ARCH 6211Site Strategies(3)Site Strategies is designed to prepare students of Architecture for site analysis prior to placing architectural projects in urban and non-urban contexts. Architects need to be aware of the complexities of a site in order to place a structure, understand the impacts of that placement, and to positively contribute to mitigating climate change. This class also teaches a few key skills for understanding a site: first, to understand drawing as a mode of inquiry and as a disciplinary tool to dissect the reality; and two, to develop the ‘ecological view’ of the reality.
