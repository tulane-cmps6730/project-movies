EDUC 6040Curriculum, Instruction, & Assessment for All Learners(3)This course provides the foundation for narrowing the gap between the intended, implemented, and achieved curriculum in a given educational context.  The course examines definitions and models for high-quality curricula while unearthing the aims of education implied by the standards for excellence used; it also examines approaches to learning standards and their relationship with learner-centered educational approaches to teaching.  Instructionally, the course surveys foundational mindsets, classroom management, instructional strategies, and student motivation through the lens of culturally-relevant practices.  It also examines the best avenues for assessment for and of learning particularly in the on-going high-stakes environments of public education.  With New Orleans as a learning laboratory of differing approaches, the course culminates in an examination of current realities versus ideal practices with respect to the question:  Does all really mean all?
