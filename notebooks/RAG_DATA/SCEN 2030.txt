SCEN 2030Anatomy(3)The purpose of this course is to aid students in acquiring an understanding of, and new appreciation for, the structures of the human body and their relationships using a regional approach. Early in the course, students are introduced to structural, directional, and regional terminology. Students are introduced to structures at the tissue level, differentiating between cell structure and function. Using this foundation, the curriculum guides students through segments of the body, primarily focusing on the skeletal, muscular, nervous, and cardiovascular systems while introducing basic anatomy of visceral organs.Prerequisite(s):CELL 1010orEBIO 1010.
