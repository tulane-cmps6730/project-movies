SCEN 1010Communicating Science:Teaching(1)As the high schools in New Orleans rebuild, one of their many challenges is the uneven level of preparation among students entering the 9th grade. At the New Orleans Charter High School for Science and Math (SciHi), founded by two Tulane professors, the students are motivated but the disparities in their backgrounds are enormous. In this course, we learn how to help high school students who've fallen behind, both academically and by understanding the origins of their difficulty. Then we apply that knowledge by working with the students and also fulfilling one of the Tulane Center for Public Service requirements. The service, a minimum of 30 hours over the course of a semester, can take the form of teaching, tutoring, assisting with in-class exercises, and always includes acting as a mentor and role model to the SciHi students.Corequisite(s):SCENÂ 1890.
