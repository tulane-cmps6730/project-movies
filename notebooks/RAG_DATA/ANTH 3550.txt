ANTH 3550Social Change, Sustainability, and Postcolonial Identity in the Caribbean(3)The St. Martin Program is an intensive, immersive service-learning program that combines a 3-credit class (ANTHÂ 3550: Social Change, Sustainability, and Postcolonial Identity in the  Caribbean) with community engagement. The course is based in the small binational island of St. Martin (Lesser Antilles). It includes a mandatory, zero-credit service-learning component, which will satisfy one tier of the public service graduation requirement. The primary purpose of the program is for students to meaningfully engage with locals, work and meet with community members committed to cultural, food, and economic sustainability, as well as gain an in-depth understanding of anthropological concepts and research methodology, especially as they relate to postcolonial contexts and the shaping of cultural/linguistic identities and socio- economic/political systems.
