SISE 3320Facilitating Comm Engagement(3)This practicum is a requirement for ongoing participation in the Community Engagement Advocates program and requires applied work in facilitating
social justice dialogues. The student facilitators in this class will participate in weekly experiential sessions: to observe, practice, learn and prepare for their work as peer-to-peer facilitators and student leaders working for collective impact; to strengthen their own understanding of social justice, identity
development and multicultural education in the context of community engagement and service learning; to further develop their community and co-facilitation relationships and experience; and to continue their own personal growth and development in the areas of facilitation and social justice.
