HMLS 3600Critical Infrastructure(3)This course introduces participants to the Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP) process to secure the effective protection of the people, physical entities, and critical information systems. This course will introduce a time-efficient and resource-restrained practice that ensures the protection of only those infrastructures upon which survivability, continuity of operations, and mission success depend. The CIP course will guide leaders in the theories of physical protection and conducting vulnerability assessments of critical infrastructures. This course will also introduce the critical sectors currently identified by the United States Department of Homeland Security and how disruption of these sectors affects civilians and the economy.
