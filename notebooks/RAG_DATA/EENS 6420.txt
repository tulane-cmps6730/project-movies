EENS 6420Applied Basin Analysis(3)This course focuses on practical applications of stratigraphy, structural geology and petroleum geology. It is designed around a dataset for an individual hydrocarbon basin that will typically include seismic reflection data and well data. Datasets will vary from year to year, as the course will be coordinated with AAPG's Imperial Barrel award program. Students work as a team, however each student has a clear role and responsibility to the ultimate goal, which is a geologically valid interpretation of the basin that makes predictions about the hydrocarbon prospectively of the study area. Emphasis is on teamwork, participation, oral and written communication of results. Practicum format (non-lecture).
