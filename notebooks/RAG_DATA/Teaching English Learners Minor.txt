Teaching English Learners, Minor Overview Requirements The Teaching English Learners (TEL) minor is designed for current Tulane students who have an interest in teaching English learners and/or wish to take relevant courses in order to prepare them for future professional goals. With this minor, Tulane students entering the United States K-12 education system are equipped to provide better support for multilingual learners of English in their classrooms and schools. The TEL minor also prepares Tulane students for a variety of other professional pathways, including but not limited to graduate school, Teach for America, teaching/ training abroad, and the Peace Corps. The courses included in the TEL minor provide Tulane students with a strong foundation in the pedagogical principles and practices that form the basis of an equitable, inclusive learner-centered approach to supporting multilingual learners of English and their families in both academic and non-academic contexts. Students develop the mindsets, knowledge, and skills to act as advocate-allies that are ready and able to support not only the educational outcomes of multilingual learners of English but also contribute to the overall thriving of these learners in their local communities and beyond.
