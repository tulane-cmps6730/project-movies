CELL 4430Introductory Bioinformatics(3)The aim of this course is to introduce biology and computer science students to computational research techniques using biological data. This field, generally referred to as bioinformatics, is growing faster then the current workforce available. We will cover the experimental methods used to create the biological data, how to understand the data in the context of biology, and the common computational methods used to derive understanding and make hypothesis from this data. The course will be taught through relevant, hands on projects, and all the tools are computer based. The projects will be based around "omics" data, which is the basis of personalized medicine and precision oncology. This course is designed to be approachable for all students, regardless of their current computational abilities or computer ownership.
