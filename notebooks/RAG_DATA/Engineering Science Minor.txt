Engineering Science Minor Overview Requirements Students not majoring in biomedical engineering, chemical engineering, or engineering physics may earn a minor in Engineering Science by completing the Engineering Science minor. Interested students should contact the Associate Dean of the School of Science and Engineering to declare the minor and discuss the requirements. Students not majoring in biomedical, chemical engineering or engineering physics may earn a minor in Engineering Science by completing the following courses: Prerequisite Math and Science Courses Course List Course ID Title Credits MATH 1210 Calculus I 4 MATH 1220 Calculus II 4 MATH 2210 Calculus III 4 MATH 2240 Intro To Applied Math 4 or MATH 4240 Ordinary Differentl Equa PHYS 1310 General Physics I 4 PHYS 1320 General Physics II 4 Not all of the above math courses are required prior to taking 1000-2000 level engineering courses. See individual course descriptions for details. Note: The following courses may be required for some engineering course options: Course List Course ID Title Credits CHEM 1070 & CHEM 1075 General Chemistry I and General Chemistry Lab I 4 CHEM 1080 & CHEM 1085 General Chemistry II and General Chemistry Lab II 4 Engineering Courses Required Course List Course ID Title Credits Select two of the following: 6 ENGP 1410 Statics 3 ENGP 2010 Electric Circuits 3 CENG 2110 Matl & Energy Balances (Additional Prerequisite: CHEM 1070 , 1080 ) 3 CENG 2120 Thermodynamics I 3 ENGP 2430 Mechanics of Materials (Prerequisite: ENGP 1410 ) 3 CENG 2500 Intro To Biotechnology (Additional Prerequisite: CHEM 1070 , 1080 ) 3 ENGP 3120 Materials Science and Engineering (Additional Prerequisite: CHEM 1070 , 1080 ) 3 Select one of the following: 3 BMEN/ENGP 2310 Product & Experimental Design 3 BMEN/ENGP 2020 Comput Concepts & Applic 4 Select two 3000-4000 level electives in either biomedical, chemical engineering or engineering physics 6 Engineering Science Minor with an SSE Major Twenty-four credits in the major may not overlap with the minor. Student must earn a GPA of at least 2.00 in courses counting toward the minor. No courses counting toward a student's first minor will count toward the student's second minor.
