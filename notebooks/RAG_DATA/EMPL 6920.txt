In addition to providing information about the legal operation of various types of employee benefits, we will also examine what such plans require in terms of fiduciaries and how these plans are to be regulated in the event of bankruptcy. The bulk of our engagement will be with the federal law. Throughout the course we will engage with the current legal and political frameworks, as well as legislative developments in this field and discuss where things are headed.Prerequisite(s):EMPLÂ 5710and6910.
