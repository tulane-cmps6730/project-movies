NSCI 6370Molecular Neurobiology(3)Introduction to the molecular biology of neurons and neuronal function. Topics of study will include: the molecular composition of nerve cells, and how this provides a basis for their functional properties; their synaptic connectivity; how they receive, transmit and retain information at a molecular level. Studies will focus on current research in the field of molecular neurobiology. In addition, a term paper is required. Open to undergraduates by petition who plan to transfer credit to the 4+1 Program in Neuroscience.
