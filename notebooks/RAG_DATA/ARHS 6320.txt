ARHS 6320Colonialisms in Latin American Art(3-4)According to the conventional geography of art history, “colonial” art was produced in peripheral spaces, lacking political (and consequently artistic) autonomy. An art history that centered metropolitan and imperial capitals inevitably cast on “colonial” art as something less than –in quality, in originality—that of these centers. New paradigms, however, have emerged in the wake of critiques of a Euro-centric world order, and the practice of art history shaped by it.
This course focuses on recent art historical scholarship and exhibitions, almost all from the past decade, that deals with colonial art and the new paradigms of research and theory being developed for it. While much of the course will deal with colonial Latin America, we will also look to other colonial situations, including British India, Australia, and Ghana. During the last weeks of the course, we will also look at the work of post-colonial contemporary artists, who see themselves as the inheritors and interrogators of colonial legacies.
