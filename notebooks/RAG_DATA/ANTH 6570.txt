ANTH 6570Indigenous Movements in Latin America(3)This course will give an overview of indigenous movements in Latin America and reflect on the advantages and shortcomings of these movements’ recent approaches to rights discourses in the face of legal and extrajudicial forms of state violence. By comparing cases from Mexico, Guatemala, and Bolivia, we will analyze the connections between colonialism, the implementation of neoliberal policies, institutional racism, and states’ recognition and application of indigenous rights.
