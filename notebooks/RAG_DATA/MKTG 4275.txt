The course takes an in-depth look at the relationship between intellectual property, product development, and marketing. Explorations of these topics range from how to identify potential intellectual property rights to how protect those rights by using a variety of intellectual property protections such as patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade dress, and trade secrets to give a firm a comparative advantage. Further, the course will examine strategies for addressing competitors that infringe on a firm’s intellectual property rights through techniques such as litigation and licensing.
