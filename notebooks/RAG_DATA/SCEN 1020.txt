SCEN 1020Comm Sci:1st Lego League(1)If you are looking for a service learning opportunity this fall, in this course, you will mentor a middle-school robotics team using FIRST LEGO League (FLL) as a platform. Typically run on-site as an after-school program, FLL provides motivation in STEM fields (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) by requiring middle-school students to design and build a LEGO robot and prepare a 5-minute research presentation on the theme of the challenge. Past themes have involved Trash/Recycling, Natural Disasters, Senior Citizens, Biomedical Engineering, Climate, Energy, and Nanotechnology. Tulane students will assist the teams throughout the semester and will accompany them to the qualifying competition in New Orleans in November and potentially the state competition in New Orleans in December if the team advances. Previous robotics experience is not required.
