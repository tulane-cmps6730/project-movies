HIST 3210Visual History & Filmmaking(3)In this course students will explore the relationship between history and documentary filmmaking through parallel practices: the critical analysis of historical documentaries and the creation of short historical documentaries as members of small production teams. We will explore questions of narrative form, visual and aural evidence, expertise and authority, and the ethics of representation. Collaboration will also be a central theme of this course since students will have to work together to determine their research subject, carry out research, shoot video, and edit together the final cut.
