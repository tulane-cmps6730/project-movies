BMEN 3820Math Analysis Bio Systms(3)The objective of this course is to teach basic mathematical modeling constructs and analysis techniques that are used for studying biological processes. Topics to be covered include ordinary differential equations, compartment systems, basics of dynamic systems, stability, statistical inference and model construction. These will be applied to study models of chemical kinetics, physiological control, AIDS transmission, population dynamics, and growth. Students will use Mathematica to develop and analyze models.
