Applied Mathematics, MS Overview Requirements This program is designed to provide students with the opportunity to broaden and deepen their knowledge of mathematics with an emphasis on those areas that have been most important in science and engineering. The student will also examine, through seminars and case studies, examples of significant applications of mathematics to other areas. This expanded base of knowledge, together with extensive experience in problem solving should prepare the student for further studies leading to the Ph.D. degree or for immediate employment in many areas of industry and government. To enter the program the student should have a Bachelor's degree in mathematics, or a related field, and have completed undergraduate courses in Linear Algebra and Differential Equations. Students without these prerequisites may take them without credit toward the M.S. degree. Partial tuition waivers may be available to qualified students.
