MPAD 7120Reimagining and Leading Education Systems for the Future(3)This course supports education leaders in developing and communicating a vision and strategy for student success centered on excellence and equity for all. The early part of the course includes a historical overview of schooling in the U.S. and the influence of this history on the features and limitations of the
current system, including the educational implications of race and poverty. The course also includes an investigation of shifts in learning, management, and equity, as well as a survey of promising systemic reforms and strategies such as integrated student supports, collective impact, and cross-sector collaboration. Key skills of effective education leaders include communicating and building support for vision and change. Students will also develop a public narrative and strategic communication plan around their vision and strategy. Questions include: What are the vision, qualities, and characteristics of
future-focused, future-ready learning organizations? How can a leader move from vision to transformational change for students? The course will include a variety of texts, including interviews with leaders in the field, as well as specific instruction in design thinking and strategic communication.
