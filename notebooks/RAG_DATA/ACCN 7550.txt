ACCN 7550Public Accounting Internship(3)The busy season internship is a full-time, paid internship with a major accounting firm in the spring semester. Typically, the internship takes place in the city and state in which the student plans to live and work. Students earn three graduate-level credit hours for the internship, which runs from approximately January 1 through April 15. Because this internship is full-time, students may not take coursework concurrent to the internship. Following completion of the internship, students return to campus for nine credit hours of intensive coursework until mid-May. The busy season internship provides students with a realistic introduction to the accounting profession. Since seniority in most CPA firms is primarily measured by the number of busy seasons worked, graduates who pursue the internship will have a professional advantage over students who graduated the previous May.
