International and Comparative Law, LMI Overview Requirements The breadth and depth of the international and comparative law curriculum at Tulane Law School provide unparalleled opportunities for both US and foreign lawyers to receive a basic foundation in international legal practice. Tulane’s program offers courses in public international law, private international law including international business transactions, and comparative law. Tulane’s unique perspective in a historically mixed common law-civil law jurisdiction results in an unusually rich experience for students. Tulane offers its students a strong faculty with significant international experience and training, an outstanding library, and the resources of the Eason-Weinmann Center for Comparative Law, which brings together outstanding legal scholars from various countries and legal systems for seminars and lectures. Each student's course of study is at least somewhat dependent upon the background and previous legal education of the individual student and on the student's objectives. For example, US students interested in European legal studies would need exposure to European legal sources and European Community Law. A student from Germany, however, might focus her studies somewhat differently, seeking exposure to common law subjects and to other areas which she would be unlikely to have studied previously. Each student designs his or her course of study with the assistance of a faculty advisor. In addition to fulfilling the General Degree Requirements, all candidates for the LLM in International & Comparative Law are required to enroll in a total of 13 semester hours of international and comparative law courses. All students who have not already taken a public international law course are required to take Public International Law, with the remaining 10 hours of specialized coursework chosen from the following offerings: Civil Law Seminar Comparative Law: European Legal Systems European Union Law European Law of Obligations: French or German European Legal History Foreign Affairs and National Security Human Rights Discourse Immigration Law International Sale of Goods Transnational Litigation International Business Transactions International Commercial Arbitration International Criminal Law International Environmental Law International Human Rights International Income Tax International Intellectual Property International Trade, Finance and Banking Law of the Sea Maritime and National Security Law Products Liability & Mass Torts in Comparative Perspective Any one-credit mini-courses in international and comparative law
