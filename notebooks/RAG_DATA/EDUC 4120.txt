EDUC 4120Teaching Science in the Early Childhood Classroom(3)This course will prepare prospective teachers to teach science and social studies in the early childhood setting (preschool through 3rd grade). This course covers methods for teaching developmentally appropriate topics in science (earth space science, physical science, life science, and engineering/technology/ and social studies (civics, history, geography, and economics). Emphasis will be placed on developmentally appropriate instruction and active learning strategies, including the use of technology in instruction, inquiry-based learning and on performance-based assessment. Students will work with manipulatives and technology to explore science and social studies, solve problems, and learn ways to teach this content to children. They will also practice creating and refining age-appropriate unit and lesson plans based on the Understanding by Design model (Wiggins & McTighe).Prerequisite(s):EDUCÂ 3801.
