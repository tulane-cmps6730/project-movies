GESS 4940Gender & Sexuality Theory I(3,4)This course is the first in a sequence of two courses (see GESS 4/6950) on feminist and queer theory. The primary goals of this course are 1) to provide an introduction to early feminist theories of patriarchy, women's oppression, and gender inequality, 2) map the emergence of subsequent theories of the social construction of gender and gender difference including the sources, causes, and effects of gender inequality and strategies for reducing or eradicating inequality, and 3) identify how intersectional, postmodern, and queer thinkers enter into dialogue with and critique early feminist theorizing.
Course may be repeated up to unlimited credit hours.
