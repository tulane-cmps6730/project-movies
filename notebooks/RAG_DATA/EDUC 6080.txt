EDUC 6080Culminating Capstone Project(3)In this course, students apply concepts, theories, best practices, knowledge, and principles as learned throughout the program.  Students grapple with the complexities of teaching and learning by testing concepts, strategies, and approaches in real-world contexts.  Through a site-based immersion project completed through options such as fieldwork, internships, or simulations, students demonstrate master of the program competencies and learning objectives.  Students present findings through written reports and presentations that are subject- and context-specific, tailored to the appropriate audiences, and clear on the implications for teaching and learning.
M.Ed. program students with less than three years of relevant work experience participate in a capstone with an experiential, site-based component where a project is shaped and applied on-site. Elements include problem identification, standards of excellence, key stakeholders, facilitating and hindering factors, strategic recommendations, implementation, analysis, interpretation, and implications.Prerequisite(s):(EDUCÂ 6000,6020,6040and6060).
