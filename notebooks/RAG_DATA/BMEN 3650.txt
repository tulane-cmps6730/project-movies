BMEN 3650Biomechanics and Biotransport(3)This course introduces students to biomechanics and biotransport. Specific topics include: the analysis of forces and stresses/strains in biological structures under loading; constitutive models for biological materials; the relationship between structure and function in tissues and organs. These topics will be related to fundamental principles of fluid mechanics and mass transport of biological systems at the cellular, tissue, and organ levels including cell adhesion and migration; intracellular, transmembrane and transvascular transport; drug transport and pharmacokinetics. Fulfills departmental 'domain" requirement.Prerequisite(s):ENGP 2430andBMEN 3440.Corequisite(s):BMEN 3651.
