ANTH 3020Ethnobiology(3)In general, ethnobiology explores relationships between local societies and surrounding biota. Trajectories within the field over time have researched nomenclature, classification, use, and management of natural resources in diverse cultural contexts on several continents. This course investigates the past, present, and future of the field while presenting its applications as it relates to conservation of traditional knowledge, culture, and natural resources. Delving into branches of ethnobiology, namely ethnobotany, anthrozoology, ethnomycology and ethnoecology we will explore the vast human-nature relationships across the globe, while concomitantly interrogating our own relationship with the natural world.
