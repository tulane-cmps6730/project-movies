CLIN 5310Juvenile Litigation Clinic(3)In the Juvenile Clinic 10 students represent indigent clients in juvenile delinquency cases, and children in need of care cases.  Students work under the direction of the supervising attorney, but the students are primarily responsible for all client and witness interviews, pre-trial hearings, trials and appeals.  The course must be taken in conjunction with the Juvenile Advocacy Seminar. The course lasts the entire year and carries 3 credits in the fall and 3 credits in the spring. Students are selected during the spring of their second year based upon written applications and personal interviews with the supervising attorney. Professor Katner plans to invoke a rule penalizing students for lack of preparation and/or excessive absenteeism. Course may be repeated 2 times for credit.
