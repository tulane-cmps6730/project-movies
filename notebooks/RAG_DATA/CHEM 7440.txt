CHEM 7440Adv Organic Polymer Chemistry(3)This course establishes a basic fundamental background for polymer chemists, including the major synthetic techniques for preparing polymers, the strengths and weakness of various techniques for determining molecular weight and structure, as well as correlation between polymer molecular structure and the resultant physical properties (and therefore useful applications).
