Chemical Engineering Major Overview Requirements Chemical engineering combines principles of chemistry, physics, biology, and mathematics to design processes that economically and sustainably meet human needs for energy, food, healthcare, and technology. Chemical engineers are not only leaders in traditional chemical, oil and gas, and brewing industries, but they are also at the forefront of advancements in pharmaceutical discovery and production, renewable energy, biotechnology, and environmental protection. The Chemical & Biomolecular Engineering (CBE) curriculum includes basic coursework in math, physics, and chemistry, as well as advanced courses related to the design of industrial processes including fluid dynamics, thermodynamics, heat and mass transfer, computer methods, reactor design, and automatic process control. All students participate in an internship through the core curriculum. Students can readily tailor the major to their specific interests through choice of appropriate electives; synergistic focus areas include pre-medicine, biotechnology, materials science, energy, and environmental studies. Tulane's Chemical Engineering program is accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of ABET ( https://www.abet.org/ ). Core Chemical Engineering Courses Undergraduate Curriculum: The coursework necessary to graduate with a B.S. degree in Chemical Engineering can be grouped in the following categories: The engineering courses, including the core chemical engineering courses* and the engineering, technical, and advanced specialization electives The basic science and mathematics sequence, which also satisfies the university’s scientific inquiry requirements The university’s cultural knowledge (humanities, fine arts, and social science) elective courses, TIDES, public service, and the writing requirement *A minimum grade of C- must be earned in each CENG required core course in order to receive credit for the Bachelor’s degree. Undergraduate Core Requirements: The following courses are required by the university to obtain a degree: Writing (ENGL 1010, 4 credits) Scientific Inquiry (9-12 credits): Satisfied by the basic mathematics and science sequence comprising MATH 1220, 2210, 2240; PHYS 1310, 1320; and CHEM 1070/1170, 1080/1180 Cultural Knowledge (18 credits): Satisfied by at least 6 credit hours of Humanities/Fine Arts and at least 6 credit hours of Social Science Public Service (2-3 credits) TIDES Capstone Experience (9 credits): Satisfied by CENG 4310 and 4750 Two Advanced Specialization Electives, Two Advanced Technical electives, and Two Advanced Engineering Electives are selected in consultation with a faculty member in Chemical & Biomolecular Engineering, who is listed as your advisor, or by emailing the Chair of the Undergraduate Committee, Dr. Katie Russell, at krussel1@tulane.edu . Note that at least one of the Technical Electives must be at the 3000-level or above.  The same applies to the Engineering Electives. Certain modifications to the freshmen program may be made by: Achievement of advanced standing through Advanced Placement Tests offered by the CEEB Use of advanced placement tests in mathematics and chemistry offered on campus during Orientation Week Submission of transcripts from other universities for equivalent courses taken prior to entering Tulane New majors are assigned an individual faculty advisor based on their expected graduation year, and they should consult with him or her regularly for class and career planning. Faculty members can be reached by email or in person to set up meeting times.

An Engineering Elective is any non-required CENG course, a course offered by one of the engineering departments (BMEN, ENGP), or a course offered by Computer Science (COSC and CMPS). Advanced Specialization Electives are typically selected from the following list: • Any 3000-level or above CENG, BMEN, CHEM, CMPS, COSC, ENGP, MATH, MPEN, or PHYS • CELL 3030: Molecular Biology • CELL 3750: Cell Biology (pre-req: CELL 3030) • EENS 4250: Isotopes in the Environment • EENS 4360: Environmental Geochemistry (pre-req: EENS 2110) • ENRG 4100: Energy Markets, Economics, and Policy • ENRG 4110: Energy Financial Modeling • ENRG 4200: Energy Fundamentals and Trading • SPHU 3160: Biostatistics in Public Health (pre-req: SPHU 1010 and 1020) • SPHU 4160: Intro to Statistical Packages (pre-req: SPHU 3160) • SPHU 4400: Practical Bioinformatics • SPHU 4410: Data & Information Management in Public Health (pre-req: SPHU 1010 and 1020) Any Substitutions must follow the Petition for Degree Plan Modification process. Technical electives, Engineering electives, and Advanced Specialization electives must each satisfy a minimum of 6 credit hours, and at least 3 credit hours of Technical and Engineering electives must be at the 3000-level or above. For all electives, the courses must be of at least the same technical rigor as the first freshman-level course we require from that department (i.e., General Chemistry for CHEM courses, General Physics for PHYS courses, Calculus I for MATH courses. CELL 1010 is the benchmark for CELL courses). Additionally, courses containing significant overlap with core curriculum are excluded (list found here). Students are encouraged to inquire with their CBE Advisor or the Undergraduate Committee Chair if they are unsure about a potential elective. Note that a maximum of 3-credit hours can be satisfied from Professional Development Courses. Courses for non-science majors will not fulfill the elective requirements. **Students may take courses from a biochemistry series offered by either Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering (CENG 4450 and 4460) or Chemistry (CHEM 3830 and 3840) to satisfy one or both courses of the Advanced Specialization Elective requirement. Once a biochemistry course has been taken and a grade of D- or better has been granted, the parallel course from the other department cannot be taken to satisfy any elective requirement for the Chemical Engineering degree. As an example, a student who withdraws from CHEM 3830 can take CENG 4450 to satisfy the first Advanced Specialization requirement. If the student then goes on to earn credit for both CENG 4460 and CHEM 3840, one of the courses can be used for elective credit but the other ‘biochemistry II’ course will not be counted as an elective, technical or otherwise.
