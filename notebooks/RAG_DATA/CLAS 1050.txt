CLAS 1050The Romans(3)The Romans focuses on the social and cultural history of the ancient Roman world. We will examine Roman identity, institutions, society, technology, architecture, religion, and other aspects of Roman life using a variety of Roman texts alongside examples of material culture (i.e., archaeological objects, architecture, and art). The texts used in this course include excerpts of literary and historical works as well as inscriptions and graffiti.
