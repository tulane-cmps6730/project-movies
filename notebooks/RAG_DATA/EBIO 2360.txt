EBIO 2360Wetlands Ecology(3)This course explores relationships between water, soil, plants, animals, fungi and microorganisms in various types of wetlands. Wetland types include floodplain forests, fens, bogs and marshes, with an emphasis on wetlands of the Mississippi Delta Region and the Gulf Coast. The course will further examine how climate-driven sea level rise has required coastal restoration and retreat strategies.
