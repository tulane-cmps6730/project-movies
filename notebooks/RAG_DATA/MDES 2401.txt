MDES 2401Business of Media and Design(3)Advertising is all about spends: media spends, agency fees, and production expenses. In this course, students will be exposed to the wide array of costs associated with advertising. We’ll take a look at what comprises freelance and agency rate structures; how media is planned, placed, and compensated for; and how production costs and billing structures can be approached. This course will further expose the business side of advertising through developing an understanding of building viable scopes, budgets and timelines that are economically sound for both the agency and the client.Prerequisite(s):MDES 2400.
