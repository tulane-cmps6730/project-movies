EBIO 6200Ornithology(4)An investigation into the early evolution of birds, origins and mechanics of flight, anatomy and physiology, systematics, social and breeding behavior, and the diverse life histories of birds. Tulane investigators share current research and methodologies for studying birds, and highlight the most pressing conservation issues. We spend as much time as possible in the field, visiting unique habitats across southeast Louisiana and the Gulf Coast, in search of birds to observe, describe, and identify by sight and sound.Corequisite(s):EBIOÂ 6201.
