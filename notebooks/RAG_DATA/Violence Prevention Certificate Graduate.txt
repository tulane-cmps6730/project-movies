Violence Prevention Certificate (Graduate) Overview Requirements Violence is a leading health burden in the U.S. and globally and plays a significant role in shaping population health and health disparities. This concentrated training in violence prevention is aimed at improving our capacity to monitor, research, and address violence as a root cause of negative health outcomes and disparities in health. Courses in this certificate program combine theory and methods to understand and address violence from multiple levels and throughout the lifespan. Purpose Our purpose is to train scholars and practitioners in the conduct of research and evaluation methods aimed at violence prevention, one of the most important social determinants of health and health disparities. The certificate is aimed at master’s students who want training in violence prevention, specifically, preparing them for a career in violence and injury prevention. Students will be prepared to work in a variety of settings, both research and practice, and at multiple levels, but also in other non-public health and interdisciplinary settings. Competencies Articulate the causes and consequences of multiple forms of violence, and mechanisms for violence prevention. Analyze the intersection of scientific evidence and practice in violence prevention. Plan research and evaluation strategies to answer key violence prevention questions and evaluate programming, with a community-informed lens. Develop applied skills to competently engage in violence prevention efforts from a public health perspective.
