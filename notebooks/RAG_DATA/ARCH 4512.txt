ARCH 4512Professional Concerns II(3)This course exams the role BIM [Building Information Modeling] takes in defining and shaping the way we imagine and construct buildings in contemporary architectural thinking and practice. The course is structured around the idea that BIM is not truly a program for modeling: it is a medium for the communication and dissemination of information to different stakeholders in a project â€“ and as such is a tool for practice. The semester will use one BIM software, Autodesk Revit, as a case study, and through and by developing proficiency in this software and questioning its place in the discourse students will be equipped to enter the field of practice with the skills and critical thinking required to be thought leaders.
