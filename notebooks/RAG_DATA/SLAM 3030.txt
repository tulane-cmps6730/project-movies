SLAM 3030Marketing Strategies for Business and Creatives(3)Whether you are an artist figuring out how to best promote your work or a Fortune 500 company trying to reach a younger audience, marketing plays an essential role in any business endeavor. There is a reason almost every organization (business, non-profit, rock and roll band) allocates a significant portion of its budgeting to marketing, because this is the space in which the consumer learns about, connects with, and ultimately purchases whatever that product or service may be. Developing an effective marketing strategy allows a business of any kind to create value by better understanding the needs of its target audience and, as a result, offers its customer innovation and inspiration. This course will examine the fundamentals of developing a marketing strategy—branding, storytelling, communications, research and creativity—which in turn builds a successful, customer-focused organization that sustains its value over the long-term. Working with New Orleans-based organizations that have created effective marketing strategies, and others that need help on the marketing front, we will learn through a hands-on, real-world approach.
