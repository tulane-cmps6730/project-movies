INTU 2020Wellness & Resilience for College & Beyond(1)College is an exciting and stressful time for everyone. The increased freedom and independence are both exciting and daunting, leading many students to struggle in new ways or with emotions that seem to have increased in intensity. Conversely, research has shown that individuals who develop and use resilience strategies and emotion regulation skills (such as opposite action, relaxation strategies, mindfulness, and practicing gratitude) as well as build positive routines (for example, good eating and sleep habits, daily exercising, scheduling fun activities) are more likely to be effective in their job roles, involved in strong relationships, physically and mentally healthy, and satisfied with their lives overall.
