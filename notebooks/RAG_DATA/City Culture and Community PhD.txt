City, Culture, and Community, PhD Overview Requirements CCC Ph.D. Program awards degrees in three disciplines: Ph.D. in Social Work–City, Culture, and Community Ph.D. in Sociology–City, Culture, and Community Ph.D. in Urban Studies-City, Culture, and Community The City, Culture, and Community (CCC) doctoral program is a broad-based and integrative graduate education-research program that addresses relationships among the physical environment, the built environment, and social, economic, and political institutions and processes that shape cities and metropolitan regions. The intellectual focus of the CCC program is unique in bringing together interdisciplinary approaches in the social sciences, social work, architecture, law, and humanities and applying them to understand a range of issues pertaining to cities, cultures, and communities. CCC's breadth of interdisciplinary study allows students considerable flexibility to tailor their training to individual research interests while providing some depth of disciplinary training in the tracks that individual students follow: sociology, social work, and urban studies. Students must complete 53 hours of course work comprised of 24 hours of elective credits and 29 hours of required credits. For more information about the program, please consult the CCC Graduate Student Handbook. The CCC curriculum and research training give students an interdisciplinary conceptual and practical basis to study the dynamics of urban, cultural, and community change in international and comparative terms and frameworks. By interconnecting interdisciplinary and disciplinary education and training, CCC faculty members encourage graduate students to select dissertation topics that offer the potential for a cross-disciplinary approach with the Ph.D. degree awarded in “Sociology – CCC,” “Social Work – CCC,” or “Urban Studies - CCC.” The  program is designed to prepare students for professional careers in academic and non-academic settings. CCC's three principle goals are (1) to produce highly educated researchers with advanced theoretical and methodological skills and flexibility to compete in the academic, governmental, non-profit, private, and public sectors, or some combination; (2) to develop partnerships between faculty and students to extend scholarship in important areas of research, creativity, and practice to benefit the New Orleans community and society-at-large; and (3) to create new methods, theories, and innovative approaches to address the world's most challenging urban, environmental, and sustainability problems.
