ENHS 7510Emerging Issues in Water Qual(3)Burgeoning human population and urbanization is creating increased demands on fresh water resources and generating larger and more concentrated waste streams. Droughts throughout many parts of the world also have placed unique challenges on historically abundant river systems. Therefore, many communities are considering the utilization of alternative water resources, including desalination of brackish waters and the reuse of wastewater for potable and non-potable applications. This course will investigate, discuss, and debate major emerging water quality issues which threaten our water sustainability and the regulatory paradigms to address these challenges. Specific issues include emerging opportunistic premise plumbing pathogens, endocrine disrupting chemicals, pharmaceuticals, unregulated disinfection by-products, perfluorinated organic compounds, algal toxins, and others.Prerequisite(s):ENHSÂ 6030and6510.
