MGMT 6720Asia-Global Leadership Ill(3)Competing internationally is no longer limited to large multinational corporations. The globalization of production and markets, the decline in barriers to trade and the development of the internet, world wide web, and transportation technologies have allowed even small companies access to global markets and supply chains. The objective of this course is to examine ways to design a strategy for competing efficiently in global markets. In a given industry, what are the mechanisms for market entry? How can international opportunities be evaluated and understood? What are the factors underpinning the success of global competitors in a given industry? How do you redesign the value chain of the firm across the globe? How do you successfully enter foreign markets? This course has a regional focus on Asia and includes an international business consulting project and an immersion experience in Asia.
