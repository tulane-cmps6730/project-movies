EMBA 7520Leadership and Ethics(2)This course focuses on leadership and ethics in business and society.  Leadership will be analyzed in terms of personal characteristics of great leaders (what are the qualities that great leaders possess and how do we develop those qualities?) and also functional perspectives (what are the most important tasks of leaders in business?).  Ethics will be examined in practical ways.  Students will consider various philosophical perspectives on business ethics, but the courseâ€™s main focus will be peer group conversations about ethical issues.  Students will analyze ethical dilemmas and participate in role playing exercises to provoke discussion and cultivate their common sense about ethical challenges.  Students will also consider how organizations can prevent misconduct and respond to an ethical crisis.  Throughout the course, cultural differences in leadership and ethics will be emphasized.
