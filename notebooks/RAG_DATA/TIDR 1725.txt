TIDR 1725Black Culture, Power, Politics, and Leadership(1)This one-credit course complements the experience of students living in the 1963
Collective Residential Learning Community (RLC) by providing them with an equity oriented interpretative framework grounded in Black thought, experience, and history. The modular survey course was designed for first-year students interested in exploring Black history, culture, and knowledge across the African diaspora. Through this first year seminar, students will develop an appreciation and understanding of the contributions of Black people in a globalized context.
