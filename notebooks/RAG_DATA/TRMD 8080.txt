TRMD 8080Large Dataset Management and Sequencing: Part 1(3)TRMD 8080and8090are interdependent courses designed to develop skills in generating hypotheses specific to DNA sequence data, applying protocols for sample collection, analysis of large data sets, use of the MinION instrument and presentation of research findings that demonstrate rigor and reproducibility.TRMD 8080(fall semester) introduces students to the principles and theoretical bases of novel molecular methods, design studies and hypotheses to be addressed. Students learn to collect sequence data using an accessible sequencing instrument.TRMD 8090(spring semester), equips students with techniques for evaluating and analyzing large data sets, with attention to rigor and reproducibility.
The experience of these courses will be broadly applicable, regardless of the area of public health pursued.
