SRED 2020Real Estate Transactions(3)This lecture course provides a foundational survey of the key actors, instruments, business models and laws shaping the purchasing, selling, leasing, devising, and development of real estate. The course is grounded in understanding the basic principles of contract and property law. Thereafter, these laws are understood within a variety of instruments ranging from deeds and leases to mortgages and UCC-1 financing statements. Beyond the mechanics of these instruments, students are exposed to a variety of closing and financing workflows and documentation associated with transacting residential and commercial properties. These processes will then be explored within the confines of due diligence, risk management and alternative dispute resolution techniques that are utilized to manage risk, uncertainty, and litigation liabilities. Beyond core transactions, students will be exposed to those laws, regulations and contracts that shape the development process within the public and private sectors. This will include a review of zoning and land use laws, fair housing and anti-discrimination laws, construction contracting, project delivery models, and public sector procurement, financing and subsidization. Through an understanding of the transactional and regulatory aspects of real estate, students are prepared for professional practices that must negotiate a variety of public and private interests.
