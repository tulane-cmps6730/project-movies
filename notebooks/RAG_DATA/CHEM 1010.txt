CHEM 1010Introduction to Chemical Purification(3)We are all continually surrounded by chemicals, from drugs to fuel to food additives. Ensuring these materials are free of dangerous contaminants is essential for human health and development. This course will introduce students to the most important techniques for purifying chemicals. We will use what we have learned in the classroom to isolate a number of different molecules in the lab, from ethanol to inorganic materials of eye-catching color. Open to high school students only.
