TRMD 6340Diagnostic Methods in Microbiology(2)This laboratory course parallels topics presented inTRMD 6330.  The course is designed to teach students how to perform basic laboratory tests using simple techniques applicable to developing countries.  Most of these will be diagnostic tests for infectious diseases, although some clinically relevant non-diagnostic techniques will also be taught (e.g., complete blood counts).  The bulk of the course consists of hands-on laboratory experience conducting laboratory tests with clinical specimens and analyzing prepared teaching specimens.  Procedures for organism isolation and identification and rapid diagnostic kits will be covered.
