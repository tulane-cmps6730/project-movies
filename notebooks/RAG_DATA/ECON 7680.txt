ECON 7680Public Finance II(3)This version of the course might be best described as one in “the role of government in markets.” Debates about the role of government increasingly center on the specific ways in which the four main forms of government involvement—expenditures/subsidies, regulation, mandates, and public provision—are designed and implemented. The optimal policy design (i.e., the optimal role of government in these four areas), in turn, depends on the characteristics of the good/service in question.
