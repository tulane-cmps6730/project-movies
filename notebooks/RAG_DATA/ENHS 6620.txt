ENHS 6620Physical Agents & Ergonomic Hazards in the Workplace(3)Occupational exposure to temperature extremes, abnormal pressure, noise, mechanical vibration, non-ionizing radiation, and cumulative trauma/ergonomics are discussed in lecture sessions. The fundamental physics, health effects, and occurrence of these agents, along with methods for evaluating the extent of exposure and approaches to  controlling them are discussed in lectures and appropriate measurement instrumentation is demonstrated. A laboratory session on noise measurement is included. Applicable exposure standards, regulations, and guidelines are covered in detail.Prerequisite(s):ENHSÂ 6720or
