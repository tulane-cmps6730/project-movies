BEMH 6016Narrative in Medicine(3)This course is a comprehensive seminar on the importance of narrative in the practice of medicine. In it, students will examine uncertainty in clinical medicine—its sources and ineradicability—and seek to understand the role of narrative in coping with the difficulties that clinical uncertainty presents. Students will familiarize themselves with the uses of narrative in the culture of medicine and of medical education, clinical ethics, public health policy, and, especially, clinical reasoning and everyday practice.
