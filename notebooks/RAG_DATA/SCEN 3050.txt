SCEN 3050Biotech Entrepreneurship(3)SCENÂ 3050provides a multi-disciplinary exploration of "real world" topics that science and engineering researchers must consider when translating their innovations from the laboratory to the medical arena. The focus is on such processes as identifying and validating a need, brainstorming and selecting a concept, developing an intellectual property strategy, determining funding sources, and evaluating the reimbursement and regulatory pathway. The goal is to provide students with critical information pertinent to the translation of their idea or invention from original conception in the university laboratory all the way to the healthcare marketplace where it may impact patients.
