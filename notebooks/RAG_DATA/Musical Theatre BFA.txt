Musical Theatre, BFA Overview Requirements The Musical Theatre B.F.A. is a voice-focused program, with additional requirements for acting and dance.  The curriculum stresses vocal training and year-round participation in our musical theatre ensemble, Musical Theatre Workshop, as well as courses in music theory, and musicology. In addition to the one or more productions staged by the department each semester and regular student-produced performances, the program is affiliated with Summer Lyric Theatre at Tulane, an Equity summer stock company which produces three full-scale musicals every summer. The major also offers the flexibility for students to pursue courses in other fields or to double major. Admission to the Musical Theatre B.F.A. program is based on an audition, which takes place during the sophomore year.
