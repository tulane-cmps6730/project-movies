Biomedical Engineering, PhD Overview Requirements The Ph.D. is an academic degree that prepares students for careers in teaching and research. A Master's degree is not required for students seeking the Doctoral degree. The specific requirements are as follows: 1.) Distribution Requirements a. Anatomy and Physiology BMEN 6030 Anatomy & Physio for Engr (3 c.h.) / BMEN 6035 Anat & Phys for Engr Lab (1 c.h.) and BMEN 6070 Quant Physio Lec (3 c.h.) / BMEN 6075 Quant. Physiology Lab (1 c.h.) b. Biomedical Engineering Domains One course in three of the four domains, as described in Table 1. Only one (1) of the domain requirements may be satisfied through the completion of a BMEN 3xxx/6xxx domain course c. Mathematics One course in advanced mathematics (e.g., various 6000-level MATH courses) 2.) Coursework The student must demonstrate superior performance while completing 48-hours of graduate study with nine in-class “didactic” classes.
