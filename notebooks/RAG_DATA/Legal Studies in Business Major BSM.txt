Legal Studies in Business Major, BSM Overview Requirements A major in legal studies in business introduces students to the principles of the law, social values and moral concerns as they relate to business and commerce. Students gain a comprehensive foundation through business core classes on finance and accounting, as well as business law and legal writing and research. The major provides an array of special experiential learning opportunities and service-learning options such as participating in Courtwatch NOLA. Electives allow students to tailor their education to their interests through courses in sports and entertainment law, international business law, taxation and mock trial The legal studies major helps students develop essential reasoning skills that leaders face in making complicated choices under circumstances of empirical and moral uncertainty – a common theme in rapidly changing markets. Legal studies majors develop many analytic skills, including the ability to identify legal and moral issues concealed within complicated and multifaceted fact patterns; the ability to use legal and moral principles to form ethical and legal conclusions; the ability to reason by analogy between like cases and circumstances; and the ability to argue from legal and moral rules and precedents to form logically consistent recommendations for action. The legal studies major satisfies the need for a primary major but also complements other more quantitative majors or minors in such areas as finance, accounting, marketing and management. * Catalog Addenda Note: Minor curricular adjustments were made to this major in Spring 2024.
