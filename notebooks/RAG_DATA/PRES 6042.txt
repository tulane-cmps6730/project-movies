PRES 6042Preservation Studio II(6)Preservation Studio II concentrates on documenting, analyzing and planning for the
preservation of groups of buildings and their settings as a basis for understanding the
technical, theoretical and procedural aspects of urban conservation. The course includes intensive study of representative historic residential and commercial districts including streetscapes in the New Orleans region where students work both as independent researchers and in teams to learn professional preservation planning concepts and methods. This studio examines sites comprising historic buildings representing different styles and periods in various conditions where choices in restoration versus rehabilitation versus new work must be considered. Solutions for such situations will be explored with respect to current architectural preservation planning principles and procedures.
