COMM 4850Cinema Technology Modernity(3-4)Focus on cinema as a cultural practice during the early and late periods especially as it has shaped perception and experience. Films are assessed for the way they reenact the logic of key technologies and for the way they represent technologies. Cinema is also viewed as a technology of vision in its own right. In  particular, 19th century optical toys, the railroad, photography , the computer and cinema are assessed in relation to shifting conceptions of space and time, modes of experience, the terms of everyday life, and the status of mass culture and reproduction in the modern and postmodern periods.
