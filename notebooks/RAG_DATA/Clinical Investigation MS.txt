Clinical Investigation, MS Overview Requirements The Master of Science in Clinical Investigation provides training in the methods and conduct of clinical investigation for future leaders in patient-oriented research. In addition to traditional instruction in biostatistics, epidemiology and study design, this program will provide students with a strong foundation in ethics and professionalism, while developing skills in critical thinking, communication of scientific findings, leadership, and management of research studies. Program Competencies Problem formulation: Define focused research questions and testable hypotheses Methodology: Compare and select study designs for addressing clinical or translational research questions; identify a target population with consideration of socioeconomic, ethnic and cultural diversity; identify measures to be utilized while addressing reliability and validity, data quality, and cultural diversity Data management and security: Manage data using computer technology; define strategies to ensure data security and protection of privacy are maintained Data analysis and interpretation: Generate statistics that fit the study design chosen and answer research questions; identify risk/preventive factors that may contribute to outcomes and incorporate them into a research study; interpret computer output containing results of statistical procedures and graphics Scientific communication: Compile statistical output into tables and figures suitable for publication; prepare and communicate research findings to different groups of individuals through oral presentations and research papers; critically appraise the existing literature Ethics and professionalism: Describe the fundamental principles of the protection of human subjects and voluntary informed consent; describe the authority for and professional standards for the responsible conduct of research; explain the concept of good clinical practice; explain conflict of interest management in research Teamwork and leadership: Demonstrate group decision-making techniques; manage conflict; lead and manage team-based and individual projects; foster innovation and creativity The MS in Clinical Investigation Degree in Epidemiology requires 36 credits that includes: Course List Course ID Title Credits Epidemiology Course Requirements SPHL 6020 Foundations in Public Health 3 SPHL 6060 Epidemiology for Public Health 3 EPID 6230 Computer Packages for Epidemiology 2 EPID 6340 Clincal & Trnsltnl Rsrch Mthds 3 EPID 6420 Clinical Epidemiology 3 EPID 7120 Epidemiologic Methods II 3 EPID 7130 Observational Epidemiology 3 EPID 7170 Clinical Trials: Dsgn, Cndct 3 EPID 7310 Meta-Analysis 3 EPID 7990 Master's Independent Studies 1-3 or INTD 6010 Responsible Conduct of Research Biostatistics Course Requirements SPHL 6050 Biostatistics for Public Health 3 BIOS 6040 Intermediate Biostatistics 3 Elective 3 Thesis EPID 9980 MS Thesis Research 0 Total Credit Hours 36-38 Academic Standards In addition to the SPHTM academic standards, students in the MS in Clinical Investigation and those taking advanced epidemiology courses must demonstrate the following standards: All students must complete and earn a "B" or better in the prerequisite foundational course, SPHL 6060 Epidemiology for Public Health (3 c.h.) , before advancing to EPID 7120 Epidemiologic Methods II (3 c.h.) or other advanced epidemiology courses.
