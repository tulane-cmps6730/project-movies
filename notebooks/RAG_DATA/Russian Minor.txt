Russian Minor Overview Requirements The Russian Minor is housed in the Department of Germanic and Slavic Studies and is designed to provide students with the necessary skills to communicate effectively in Russian. The Russian program also seeks to familiarize students with influential literary, critical, and cinematographic works in Russian, studied within their cultural and historical context. Furthermore, the program introduces students to various ethnicities, their histories and roles in shaping today’s Russia. Finally, it provides them with an understanding of key social and political trends as well as challenges defining the Soviet and the post-Soviet eras. The Russian Minor requires 15 credits (five courses) beyond RUSS 2030. Russian Minors are required to take at least two courses taught in Russian language (including Russian 2040) and three courses taught in English, such as Masterpiece of Russian Language l and ll, Tolstoy and Dostoevsky, Soviet Jewish Experience or courses on Russian art and film. Students may also petition for permission to use one course outside the department (e.g. in Russian history or Russian politics) toward the minor. The department generally accepts transfer credit toward the minor from summer and semester study at accredited U.S. and Russian universities. No more than three courses can be counted toward the minor if the student spends an entire year abroad, and no more than 2 courses for one semester abroad.
