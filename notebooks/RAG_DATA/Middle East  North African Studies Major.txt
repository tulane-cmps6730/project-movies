Middle East & North African Studies Major Overview Requirements Middle East and North African Studies (MENA) trains students to develop critical and analytical thinking on the Middle East and the Maghreb through an interdisciplinary, transnational approach. The MENA major draws on a number of departments and programs across Tulane’s School of Liberal Arts to offer a wide array of courses introducing students to the rich history, layered politics, diverse cultures, linguistic, and religious traditions of a complex region. This background enables students to transcend simplistic generalizations and stereotypes about the region and its people while promoting students’ global literacy in an increasingly interconnected world. The MENA major prepares students to pursue careers in government, policy, trade, research, and a variety of other fields. Students must complete at least ten courses (30 credits minimum) from an approved list of Middle East-related courses. These ten courses must be distributed as follows: 1. Arabic & Hebrew courses: Students must take at least one course in Arabic beyond ARBC 2030 Intermediate Arabic (normally, ARBC 3150) or at least one course in Hebrew beyond HBRW 2030 Intermediate Hebrew I (normally, HBRW 2130 Intermediate Hebrew II).  Students who demonstrate proficiency in Arabic, Hebrew, Turkish, or Persian language in a suitable manner can substitute another Middle East-related course from the approved list for this requirement. Turkish and Persian are not offered at Tulane. 2. History courses: Students must take HISM 2200 History of Islam to 1400 and HISM 2210 History of Modern Middle East, 1750 to the Present. Students can petition to count similar courses at other universities or programs toward this requirement. 3. Arab-Israeli Conflict: Students must take one course on the Arab-Israeli conflict. 4. Politics courses: Students must take at least one of the following two courses: POLC 3340 Middle East Comparative Politics or POLI 4660 Middle East Security. 5.
