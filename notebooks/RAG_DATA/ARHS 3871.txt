ARHS 3871Introduction to African American Art and Visual Culture, c. 1700-1940(3)This course explores the production of visual and material culture related to the African American presence in what is now the United States from the eighteenth century through the mid twentieth century.  The course considers visual materials made by African American artists and artisans as well as materials by non-African Americans that feature African American subject matter (and the relationship between these two types of visual production). We will work to understand the objects featured in this course within both the specific context of the history of African American art and visual culture and the larger context of American art history in general.  Arranged roughly chronologically but more strongly guided by a thematic and topical approach, the course aims to communicate basic content information while providing students with an understanding of the kinds of dominant questions and concerns engaged by current African American art scholarship.
