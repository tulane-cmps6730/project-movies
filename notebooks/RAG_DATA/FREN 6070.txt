FREN 6070Survey of French Linguistics(3)This course introduces students to the field of linguistics as applied to French. Taking a broad approach, we will examine the major structural components of the language—phonological, morphosyntactic, and lexical—as well as sociolinguistic matters such as variation in the language (based on region, social group, style, or other factors), French speakers’ attitudes towards their language, and the question of a linguistic norm in French. No prior study of linguistics is required for this course.
