DRLS 7010Sustainability and Resilience(3)This course explores the relationship between environmental sustainability and disaster resilience. The terms “sustainability” and “resilience” are often [incorrectly] used interchangeably and each have numerous definitions depending on context. According to Cutter,1 “Sustainability is the potential to maintain the long term well-being of communities based on social, economic, and environmental requirements of present and future generations. It stresses the interdependencies of environmental protection, human needs, and societal well-being, acknowledging the primary goal of improving the human condition without harming the environment.” In this course, we will discuss a range of topics—from water to energy to food to climate change—and the challenges and pathways to sustainable practices and how these can support or limit disaster resilience.  We will pay special attention to the ways environment and equity are intertwined. Students will gain knowledge about sustainable systems and applying these concepts to disaster planning, management, and recovery.
