EMBA 6180Accounting for Managers(2)Accounting for Managers focuses mainly on the set of frameworks and methods which serve to measure, analyze, and interpret internal information to support managerial decision making as well as performance evaluation and control. Unlike financial accounting, there is no set of rules and regulations that dictate how internally generated information is reported to management. Therefore, this course focuses on methods of data measurement and interpretation, with particular emphases on: 1) the design of appropriate costing systems; 2) the use of internal information to support managerial decisions; 3) the array of evaluation tools to monitor managerial incentives and performance. The course will also provide a brief review of the financial accounting principles as needed.
