PMBA 7470Corporate Strategy(2)This course is designed to provide students with practice-oriented, nuanced, in- depth knowledge of the various aspects of the corporate strategy of the firm. “Corporate strategy” means managing the firm’s scope – in other words, managing a corporation as a portfolio of businesses: What business units should the company have in order to maximize the shareholders’ value? How should it acquire new lines of business? How should it divest the units it no longer wants? What should be the extent of the units’ autonomy?The two primary objectives in this class are first to improve students’ understanding of what makes a portfolio of businesses under a single corporate umbrella more or less valuable and second, to develop and hone the decision- making tools for properly structuring and executing acquisitions and alliances under different business situations.
