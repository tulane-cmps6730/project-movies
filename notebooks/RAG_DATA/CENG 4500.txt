CENG 4500Chemical Process Control(3)An introduction to linear control theory is presented in which processes are described mathematically through transfer functions and flow diagrams.  Laplace transforms are used on state space models to allow for description of control systems in algebraic ways.  On/off controllers are introduced, and conventional three-mode (PID) controllers are specified.  Other topics include feedback, feed-forward, closed-loop, and open-loop systems, damping and stability, plus low-order, higher-order, and nonlinear systems.Prerequisite(s):CENG 2120andMATH 2240.
