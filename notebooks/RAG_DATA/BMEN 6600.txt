BMEN 6600Comput Model Biomed Sys(4)The objective of this graduate course is to provide students with the skills and knowledge necessary for computational modeling of biological and physiological systems. The first half of the course will cover introduction to UNIX, elements of programming (Matlab and FORTRAN), and numerical methods commonly used in biomedical research. The second half will immerse the students in specific biomedical applications including hemodynamics, respiratory flow, cellular mechanobiology, and neural dynamics. Most lectures will be accompanied by computer labs.
