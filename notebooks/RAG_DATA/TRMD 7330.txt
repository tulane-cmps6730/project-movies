TRMD 7330Advanced Topics in Host Pathogens(2)This course will provide both an overview and an update on the recent advances in the study of host-pathogen interaction at the cellular and molecular levels. The focus will be on pathogen molecules that mediate interactions with host (and vector, if applicable), and the role these interactions play in host recognition and modulation, pathogen survival, virulence, and disease progression. The course will cover topics such as host specificity, immune evasion, pathogenicity and host-pathogen coevolution. Examples from the current literature will illustrate the link between basic science research in infectious diseases and our understanding of broader biological phenomena, as well as mechanisms of pathogenesis.Prerequisite(s):TRMDÂ 6170,6070and6330.
