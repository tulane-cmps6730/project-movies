ADMR 2010Admiralty I(3)This course will survey substantive matters, including carriage of goods by sea; charter parties; personal injury and death; collision; towage, pilotage, and salvage. Admiralty I is not a prerequisite for the course in Admiralty II; however, both Admiralty I and II are required for J.D. students prior to enrollment in any other Admiralty courses that are regularly offered. Advanced Admiralty courses may not be taken by J.D. students simultaneously with either Admiralty I or II.
