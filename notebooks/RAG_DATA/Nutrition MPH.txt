Nutrition, MPH Overview Requirements The MPH in Nutrition program emphasizes the social and environmental determinants of nutrition and food security and how to solve them through nutritional assessment of populations, community nutrition actions, health promotion programs, and food and nutrition policies. The program trains future public health nutritionists to manage programs and shape policies that improve the nutritional health and food security of populations. A full spectrum of contexts is addressed, including: humanitarian crises in low-income countries; sustainable development in low- and middle-income countries; and the dual burden problems of under- and over-nutrition common to middle and high-income countries. The mission of the MPH Nutrition Program is to train future public health leaders to shape policies, administer programs, and to communicate to the public to improve nutritional health and food security of population groups across a full spectrum of economic context. This program is a member of the Association of Graduate Programs in Public Health Nutrition (AGPPHN).
