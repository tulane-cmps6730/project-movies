EBIO 2770Nature Study in Scandinavia(3)More than a Walk in the Park: Nature Study in Scandinavia has two components. Half of the course is a survey of the ecosystems of Scandinavia, from boreal forests to rocky intertidal zones. We will explore the diversity and ecology of regional plant and animal communities, with reference to environmental issues including non-native species, disturbance, conservation, and management. Information about the geology, history, and culture that contribute to the formation and maintenance of each ecosystem will be included. The other half of the course will involve observing, identifying, recording, and developing questions about the local diversity of the region. Be prepared to spend a considerable amount of time outside... where nature is!
