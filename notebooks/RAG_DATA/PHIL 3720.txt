PHIL 3720Philosophy of Science(3)Science, according to most, is our best way of gathering objective knowledge about the world. But what, if anything, guarantees the “objectivity” of science?

Moreover, how should we reconcile the fact that science is geared towards knowledge with the fact that it is pursued by individuals with their own political aims, biases, and values? In this course, we will consider what characteristics of science allow for objective knowledge.
