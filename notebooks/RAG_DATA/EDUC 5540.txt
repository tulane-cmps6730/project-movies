EDUC 5540Behavior Support and Intervention(3)This course provides a framework for teaching and a problem-solving approach for developing behavioral interventions for both students with disabilities and their typical peers.  Tulane students explore strategies for developing pro-social behavior in classrooms and whole-school contexts. They also learn to implement data collection as well as direct observation to assess problem behavior, discover the functions of problem behavior, and explore pro-social alternatives for home, school and community settings.  At the completion of this course, educators will be able to discuss, evaluate, and design the appropriate interventions for students requiring additional behavior supports.Prerequisite(s):EDUCÂ 5500and5510.
