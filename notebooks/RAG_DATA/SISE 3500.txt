SISE 3500Speculative Fiction and Lessons for Social Change(3)What do imaginary worlds have to teach us about the future we want? From fantasy and horror to science fiction, Afrofuturism, cultural commentary, alternative histories and dystopian scenarios, the genre(s) of speculative fiction depict worlds that don’t exist – yet! Through intergalactic encounters, time travel, magic, advanced technologies and more, speculative fiction offers powerful critiques of our current social and environmental systems as well as alternative visions of many possible, and more inclusive worlds. These alternatives allow us to explore and critically analyze what more just, sustainable, liberating, and equitable realities might look like, and how we might imagine them into being through processes of social innovation. This class will engage with literary, musical, and cinematic works of speculative fiction with a focus on works by artists of color, who are using speculation to challenge the status quo and combat marginalization—such as those by N.K. Jemisin, Janelle Monae, Jordan Peele, Nia DaCosta, Juel Taylor, Octavia Butler, Ursula K. Le Guin, Ted Chiang, and more, to understand the lessons they offer us for social change. Students will also produce their own original world-building works through short stories, reflections, poems, drawings and/or prototypes. Through this project they will have an opportunity to offer perspectives race and/or ethnicity as social constructs in the United States.
