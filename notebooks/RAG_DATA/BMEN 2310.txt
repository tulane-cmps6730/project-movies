BMEN 2310Product & Experimental Design(3)The objective of this course is to introduce students to the design process as they are starting the BMEN Curriculum.  Through team projects geared toward translating bench research into product development, students will be challenged to begin thinking critically and applying physical fundamentals to complex systems. Weekly lectures will highlight phases of the design process, including problem identification, conceptual design, and early prototyping. Additionally, in the context of product and experimental design, students will gain experience with computer aided design and be provided an introduction to statistics. Course restricted to BMEN majors, or by permission of the instructors.
