ASTA 3540Anime, Japan & Globalization(3)This course will engage the interdisciplinary field of anime, globalization, and cultural policy studies to better understand the broader relationship between popular media, culture and politics. We will engage with select anime texts and articles to better understand how anime has developed into a global medium, and further analyze these texts through readings that deal with Japan's postwar development. Students will develop a better understanding of the history of Japanese anime as well as the global market flows that influenced the current development of anime into a massive international phenomenon.
