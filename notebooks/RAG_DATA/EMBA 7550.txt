EMBA 7550Performance Management(2)One of the cornerstones of human resource practice in any organization, performance management shifts the common focus on an annual evaluation of employee performance to an ongoing process that includes establishing an organizational climate for success, setting and aligning goals, coaching and developing employees, formally evaluating performance, and linking performance to recognition and rewards. This course will expose students to current thinking, strategies, and evidence-based best practices in these areas of performance management by incorporating perspectives of leading practitioners, consultants, and researchers in the field. The course will be conducted in an interactive and participative manner. Learning will be facilitated through lecture and discussion, case studies, interactive exercises, and student presentations.
