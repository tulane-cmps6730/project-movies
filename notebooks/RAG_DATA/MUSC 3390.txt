MUSC 3390World Vocal Traditions(3)This course is an ethnomusicological exploration of selected vocal traditions from around the world. Anchored around three sets of guest lectures and live performances by Tuvan throat singers, a Persian Jewish singer, and a singer of Afro-Cuban religious music, the course will examine both the musical sounds that voices can produce, and the ways in which these voices are woven into the cultures from which they emerge.
