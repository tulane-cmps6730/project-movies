SPAN 4131Creative Writing in Spanish(3)This course offers students the tools to articulate their ideas and experiences in a narrative form in Spanish. The course is designed to achieve this in two ways: by learning specific techniques through readings of short stories both in Spanish and English, which will be refined through numerous exercises; and by working through the semester on the crafting of at least one short story or nonfiction piece, about which the professor will make observations and suggestions as each student present drafts of their work. During the semester students will extensively practice writing, critical reading, and peer editing. The course introduces students to literary terminology and places significant emphasis on vocabulary building.
