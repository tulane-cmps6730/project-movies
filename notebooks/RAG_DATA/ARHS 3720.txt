ARHS 3720Aztec Art in Mexico Tenochtitlan(3)Intensive investigation of Aztec art as a fundamental manifestation of political and religious ideas. The course will examine the relation between art and sacrifice, and the role of ritual and performance in “activating” works of art and architecture. It will center on the art and architecture of the city of Tenochtitlan, now known as Mexico City, the heart of the empire in the past, and the current site of ongoing archeological excavations. Students will learn how to apply art historical methodologies to works of Aztec art, and share those results with a broad public through contributions to Wikipedia.
