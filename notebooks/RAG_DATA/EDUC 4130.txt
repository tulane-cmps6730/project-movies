EDUC 4130Teaching Mathematics in ECE(3)This course will prepare prospective teachers to teach mathematics in the early childhood setting (preschool through 3rd grade). This course covers both mathematical content and methods for teaching developmentally appropriate topics in arithmetic, geometry, algebra, probability and statistics, and measurement, data collection and analysis. Emphasis will be placed on developmentally appropriate instruction and active learning strategies, including the use of technology in instruction, and on performance-based assessment. Students work with manipulatives and technology to explore mathematics, solve problems, and learn ways to teach mathematics content to children. Course includes practice in creating and refining age appropriate unit and lesson plans based on Understanding by Design model (Wiggins & McTighe).Prerequisite(s):EDUCÂ 3801.
