Materials Science and Engineering, MS Overview Requirements Materials Science and Engineering (MSE) Masters Program The Tulane University Master of Science Degree in Materials Science and Engineering is an interdisciplinary degree that focuses on developing the deep understanding of materials modeling, processing, structure, properties, and performance required to solve complex technological problems. The program covers both “hard” and “soft” materials along with related devices. The MSE masters program provides preparation for professional practice in modern materials science for those technologists who wish to continue their education. Participating faculty are drawn from multiple materials-oriented departments in the School of Science and Engineering, including Chemistry, Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, Biomedical Engineering, and Physics and Engineering Physics. This rigorous program trains graduate students to become leaders in industrial, government, and university settings. The program is flexible, allowing both full-time and part-time students, along with thesis (research component) and non-thesis (coursework only) tracks. Graduates are expected to fill the growing global demand for trained materials scientists and engineers in the twenty-first century. Graduates typically find work in a number of fields, including biotechnology and health care, defense, information technologies, manufacturing, aerospace, chemical processing, and energy. Required and Elective Coursework Applicants may choose one of two paths: 30 credits of coursework OR 24 credits of coursework and a 6-credit written research thesis supervised by MSE faculty at Tulane . The required coursework for the Tulane MSE Master’s degree consists of four courses.
