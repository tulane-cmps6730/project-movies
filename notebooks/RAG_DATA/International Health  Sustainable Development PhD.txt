International Health & Sustainable Development, PhD Overview Requirements The PhD program in International Health and Sustainable Development (IHSD) prepares the next generation of global public health researchers to conduct state-of-the-art research on global health and development issues, to reduce inequities, and to shape a sustainable future for the planet. The PhD program provides students with the skills to identify, assess, and apply scientific theories and research methodologies; to conduct original scientific research studies in resource-constrained settings; to leverage research findings towards best practice and strategic planning for global health programs; and to teach, mentor and advise students, programs, development officials, and governments. Students will develop understanding of relevant theories, the capacity to employ interdisciplinary and mixed-method research approaches, cultural competency, and the skills for ethical conduct of research. Program Competencies Critique empirical and theoretical knowledge relevant to health and development issues and factors associated with inequities in resource poor settings. Formulate evocative, relevant, and clear research questions addressing global health and development issues. Generate applied qualitative and quantitative field research, including working with local partners, maintaining appropriate cultural sensitivities, addressing ethical issues, and managing and analyzing primary and secondary data. Explain research methodologies, scientific findings, and programmatic and policy implications of research findings to the scientific community and program implementers. Teach in an area of specialization, whether substantive, regional/geographic, and/or methodological.
