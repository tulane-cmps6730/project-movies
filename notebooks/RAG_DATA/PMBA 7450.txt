PMBA 7450Global Strategy(2)- is designed to measure how well students can integrate and use the knowledge and skills gained from core PMBA courses. The course is based on a management simulation in which teams of students compete against each other for business success within an industry while utilizing “real-world” decision making, strategy formulation, problem-solving, and competitive challenges. Teams must analyze the economic conditions of the simulated environment, insure smooth production, and understand their products relative to their customers, use accounting data to evaluate results and make decisions, finance operations, determine research and development targets, market products, manage employees and the team and respond to the competition.
