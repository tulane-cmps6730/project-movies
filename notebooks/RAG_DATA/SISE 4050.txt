SISE 4050Senior Seminar(1)The senior seminar provides a forum for seniors in the social innovation and social entrepreneurship minor (SISE) to synthesize their undergraduate work in this area of study. Students will critically reflect on and consolidate their knowledge and understanding of the SISE field. Through critical discussion around specific themes relevant to SISE, seminar participants will forge a deeper understanding of SISE as an approach to addressing social problems, its potential, and the nature of its critiques. A primary goal of the SISE minor is to help students embody the design thinking skills of empathy, listening, and humility and collaboration, with a focus on social impact (rather than profit or self-promotion). To that end, the class sessions offer a forum for engaging in meaningful reflection on major topics and themes studied throughout the semester and the opportunity to relate that to student’s individual experiences. The class will also help students cement their network of current and future thought partners, including peers, classmates, instructors, and guest lecturers. Students will reflect on long-term goals as active citizens and changemakers and explore next steps beyond graduation
