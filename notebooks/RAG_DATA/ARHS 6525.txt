ARHS 6525Social Practice Art(3,4)This Art History course examines the history and theory of Social Practice art, a recent mode of artmaking in which artists and art institutions collaborate with individuals and organizations to create community-specific works of art. Classroom readings and discussions will examine forms of Social Practice in relation to histories and theories of participatory, political, and activist art since the 1960s. This course includes a 20 hour service learning component with Prospect New Orleans, a citywide triennial of contemporary art with the social mission of connecting high art to the larger cultural landscape of New Orleans through community-specific works.
