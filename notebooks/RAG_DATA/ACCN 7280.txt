ACCN 7280Operational Risk Management(3)This course is for students who want to start their own business, manage a department or even a whole firm. In this course, we study operational risk and
examine how control systems can guard against these risks. We examine how to establish controls that will provide reasonable assurance that the
organization will achieve its overall goals (i.e., strategy) in an effective and efficient manner. We specifically focus on employee control; we will explore
different ways to use the control system to motivate employee effort and to direct this effort towards organizational success. In the course, students extensively
analyze and discuss cases of real organizations.
