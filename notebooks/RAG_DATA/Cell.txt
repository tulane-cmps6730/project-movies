We will focus on limbic and memory systems. A strong emphasis will be placed on in- class discussions and student presentations to enhance critical thinking and oral presentation skills.Prerequisite(s):CELL 3310orNSCI 3310.CELL 6560Pathophysiology(3)This course focuses on the molecular pathophysiology of infectious disease, immunopathology of the cardiovascular system and skin disorders.  The impact of a diseased cardiovascular system will be examined.  Concepts from cell biology, anatomy, biochemistry, and physiology are covered.  Oral presentations are required.CELL 6660Special Topics(0-4)Courses offered by visiting professors or permanent faculty. For description, consult department.

For description, consult department. Course may be repeated up to unlimited credit hours.Maximum Hours:99CELL 6710Molecular Biology of Cancer(3)The complex multistep process which transforms a normal cell into a cancer cell, carcinogenesis, will be examined with emphasis on current molecular insights. Major topics include oncogenes, tumor suppressor genes, tumor viruses, genetic instability, metastasis, the regulation of gene expression in cancer cells, and cancer treatment strategies. This course also requires students to analyze and present research papers.CELL 6730Neurodevelopment and Disease(3)The assembly of a functional nervous system is one of the most complex developmental processes in nature. This course provides advance knowledge on the mechanisms controlling nervous system development, at the cellular, circuit, and functional levels, and how failure on these mechanisms underlie neurodevelopmental disorders. Also, this course will introduce the student to most current techniques and research topics on neurodevelopment.CELL 6750Cell Biology(3)An examination of the structure and function of eukaryotic cells. Emphasis is placed on mechanisms of intracellular and transmembrane transport, cellular control, and intercellular and intracellular signaling. Experimental methods and applications will be emphasized.  A term paper is required as part of this course.CELL 6755Cell Biology Lab(1)Laboratory experience in in vitro methodologies. Students will learn to maintain and manipulate mammalian cell cultures.CELL 6840Current Topics Dev Biol(2)Reports and discussions of current literature on developmental processes.

Course may be repeated 2 times for credit.Course Limit:2CELL 7260Graduate Communications(3)In today's competitive science market place, effective communication can be the deciding factor in obtaining postdoctoral fellowships, faculty positions or alternative career options, as well as in getting grants funded and manuscripts published. Deliberate practice of these skills is therefore critical for graduate level science trainees. This course will involve extensive discussion and practice of oral and written communication. By the end of the semester, students will have prepared a draft of their proposals required for qualifying exams and will receive input on the clarity, rigor, format, grammar, and writing style of this document. This course is open to Ph.D. students only, and is recommended to students in their 4th semester of graduate study.CELL 7450Genome Biology(3)Genome-level science is changing the pace of biomedical research and medicine. This course will examine how whole genomes, transcriptomes, and proteomes are studied, and what we are learning about the biology of multiple organisms using these novel techniques. Epigenetics, genomics. and proteomics will be covered in the context of disease and the development of novel therapeutics.CELL 7860Master's Seminar(3)Course may be repeated up to unlimited credit hours.Maximum Hours:99CELL 7870Doctoral Seminar(1)Course may be repeated up to unlimited credit hours.Maximum Hours:99CELL 7940Trasfer Credit-Grad(1-12)Course may be repeated up to unlimited credit hours.Maximum Hours:99CELL 7990Research(1-9)Individual research supervised by faculty.CELL 8000Research(3)Individual research supervised by faculty.CELL 9990Dissertation Research(3)Course may be repeated up to unlimited credit hours.Maximum Hours:99
