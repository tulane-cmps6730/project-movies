Accounting, MACCT Overview Requirements The Master of Accounting (MACCT) degree, a STEM-designated program, prepares college graduates for successful careers in public accounting firms and major corporations. Through a comprehensive, industry-endorsed curriculum which requires 30 credit hours, students develop analytical skills and acquire the professional expertise to take on the challenges of a professional accounting career. The MACCT program offers two-semester and three-semester options, the latter of which allows time for students who begin their studies in the fall to complete a summer internship. Freeman also offers a five-year joint Bachelor of Science in Management/Master of Accounting (BSM/MACCT) program. This course of study is designed to give students the knowledge, skills and preparation to immediately enter the accounting profession following graduation. In just five years, students graduate with two degrees, eligibility to sit for the CPA exam in the jurisdictions of their choice, and the confidence and expertise to become an accounting professional. Curriculum Prerequisites To be admitted to the MACCT program, a student must have an appropriate undergraduate background in accounting or business and have satisfactorily completed the following prerequisite courses: Financial Accounting Principles [ ACCN 2010 Financial Accounting (3 c.h.) or equivalent] - Concepts, techniques, and conventions for measuring and communicating the results of operations and the financial position of a business enterprise are introduced. Emphasis is placed on the development and use of publicly-reported financial information. Managerial/Cost Accounting Principles [ ACCN 3010 Managerial Accounting (3 c.h.) or equivalent] - The role of accounting information in management decision-making for profit-seeking organizations is emphasized. The importance of information to decision-relevance is developed through study of traditional cost accounting, managerial economics, operations research, and the behavioral sciences. Intermediate Accounting I and II [ ACCN 3100 Intermediate Accounting I (3 c.h.) and ACCN 4110 Intermediate Accounting II (3 c.h.) or equivalent] - These conceptually-oriented courses introduce intensive examination of financial reporting issues, financial statement categories, and the institutional environment of financial accounting. Students may complete the prerequisite courses in their undergraduate programs or prior to MACCT matriculation at a school accredited by The Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB).

All State Boards of Accountancy require evaluation and approval of a candidate’s academic credentials prior to sitting for the exam. See the National Association of State Boards of Accountancy (NASBA) website at https://nasba.org/ for more details including links to the state/territory jurisdictions as well as services that provide academic evaluations of coursework and credentials. Students who do not have an undergraduate business degree may need to take additional courses to qualify to sit for the CPA exam.

Requirements for the tax major and all specializations within the MACCT program follow. Students may not count the same course for multiple specializations.
