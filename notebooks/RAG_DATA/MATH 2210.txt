MATH 2210Calculus III(4)A basic course in differential and integral calculus of several variables. Vectors in the plane and space. Vector functions, derivatives, arc length, curvature. Functions of several variables: continuity, partial derivatives, chain rule, gradient, optimization, Lagrange multipliers. Double and triple integrals: change of variables, polar coordinates, cylindrical and spherical coordinates, surface area. Vector fields: gradient, curl, divergence, line and surface integrals, Green's, Stokes', and Divergence theorems.
