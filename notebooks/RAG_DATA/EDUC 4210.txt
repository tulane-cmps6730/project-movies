EDUC 4210Secondary Method I: General(3)This course focuses on prominent methodological issues and the development of core teaching skills. Students will analyze different instructional methods; design comprehensive unit and lesson plans using the Understanding by Design model; develop integrated technology strategies and develop skills in differentiated instruction. Emphasis is placed on development of skills of self-analysis, reflection, and research-based decision-making. Students will interpret, refine, and demonstrate their understanding and mastery of general teaching practices through forty hours of field experience in a middle or high school setting. The course is designed to be very practicum-oriented; therefore, it is organized to provide time for one-on-one conferences in which the professor will advise on upcoming lessons and give detailed feedback on classroom observations. The regular class sessions are designed to be experiential, in which students will learn and participate in specific lessons and activities to use for classroom teaching, employing a variety of materials.Prerequisite(s):(EDUCÂ 3410and3893).
