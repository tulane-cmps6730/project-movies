German Studies Major Overview Requirements German Studies provides students with a wide range of opportunities to explore culture, literature, and language of the German-speaking countries. Such studies may fulfill the language requirement, serve as part of the general education, or lead to an in-depth course of study as a German Studies major, double major, or minor. The study of German prepares students for academic careers in fields such as history, art history, religion, philosophy, political science, literature, and music as well as for professional careers that emphasize the international aspects of business, law, economics, finance, government, science, engineering, and education. The major in German Studies consists of a total of 30 credits or ten courses beyond GERM 2030 Intermediate German (4 c.h.) , with 4 Foundational courses (12 credits) and 6 Advanced courses (18 credits). All German studies majors complete three advanced courses, one 4000/6000-level course, one Advanced Undergraduate Seminar and one Senior Seminar. The three advanced courses may include up to two courses taught in English at the 3000-level (providing there is a significant reading and writing requirement in German) and/or up to two electives at the advanced level in a related field outside the department, e.g., courses in German art, history, music, philosophy, and politics. A student entering Tulane without any prior German knowledge could take beginning language classes his/her first three semesters, and then take an average of two courses for the next five semesters.
