BMEN 3440Biofluid Mechanics(3)This class focuses on fundamental concepts and properties of fluid mechanics with applications to the body. Topics to be covered include basic equations of fluid statics, dynamics and mass transport in differential and integral form using both system and control volume viewpoints. Rheological properties of biological fluids are studied as well as dimensional analysis and similitude. Advanced applications are investigated using the finite element method.Prerequisite(s):ENGP 1410,2430andMATH 2240.
