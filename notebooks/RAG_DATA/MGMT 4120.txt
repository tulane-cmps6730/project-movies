MGMT 4120Corporate and Cooperative Strategy(3)MGMT 4120teaches students to analyze firms that manage multiple businesses. The primary goal is to understand how different businesses create value at the corporate level and for customers over and above the market. This case-based approach followed in the course emphasizes the analysis of the drivers of value creation and value destruction in a multi-business firm. Using the frameworks learned in the class, students will examine the scope of diversified firms and analyze different ways firms leverage to expand their corporate scope, including mergers and acquisitions, alliances and informal inter-organizational networks. By analyzing the past decisions of diversified firms through extensive group discussions and individual assignments, students will learn to make corporate-level decisions related to 1) what business a firm should own, 2) how it should enter those businesses, and 3) how these businesses together create value for the firm and its customers. The course also includes a group project.
