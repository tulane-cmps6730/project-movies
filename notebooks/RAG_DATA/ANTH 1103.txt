ANTH 1103Great Hoaxes and Fantasies in Archaeology(3)This course studies popular fantasies, cult theories, and hoaxes in the study of the ancient world to explore the role of archaeology in the development of popular notions versus scientific understandings about the past. Furthermore, this course will explore how archaeology can, in fact, identify unscientific research approaches, determine the validity of these notions, and counteract those modern biases and prejudices that give rise to them.
