BMEN 3400Biomaterials & Tissue Engineering(3)This course will focus on fundamental materials science and biological principles that impact the engineering design of biomaterials and tissue-engineered products. Topics addressed will include structural hierarchies of materials and tissues, physical and chemical properties of surfaces, degradation of materials, and cell-surface, cell-cell, and cell-matrix interactions. The course will conclude with inflammatory, immunological, and pathological events associated with responses to such products. Laboratory exercises will be utilized to illustrate selected concepts, introduce assessment methods, and provide hands-on experiences with cells and materials. Fulfills departmental domain requirement.  An additional non-graded once a week lab section to accompany lectures.Prerequisite(s):CELL 1010,ENGP 3120andBMEN 2600.Corequisite(s):BMEN 3401.
