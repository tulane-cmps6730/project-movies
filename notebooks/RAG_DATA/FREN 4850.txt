FREN 4850Morocco in Film and Literature(3)In this course, we will read texts and discuss films that stage questions of relations between North Africa, Africa, the Middle East and US/Europe; colonial and post-independence art, migration and exile; evolving Islam; Jewish and Berber minority identities; circulation and dislocation in contemporary global and local cultures. While we will be reading, screening, and discussing in English, your competence in Arabic, French, Spanish, Hebrew or Berber can be helpful as you research your midterm and final papers for the course. We will be paying attention to the history and theory of literature and film as well as the specificity of the examples from Morocco. Films and readings are often paired in order to cover the politics, social and artistic movements and events of historical periods, as well as of contemporary cultural production.
