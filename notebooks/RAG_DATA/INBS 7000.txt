INBS 7000Business Modeling and Marketing(3)This course will develop in the student the balance between creative and analytical marketing skills needed to identify, design and fine-tune a business idea, either within a corporation or a start-up. The creative mindset will be developed through hands-on experience while proposing, iterating, and zooming into a business idea, and translating it into a coherent business model and its value proposition for a specific target audience. In conjunction with the business modeling experience, the student will analytically understand key concepts of strategic and operational marketing including market segmentation, targeting, and positioning, in addition to the basic steps of an integrated marketing communications strategy.
