MUSC 1900Music in New Orleans(3)This course is intended as an introductory survey of New Orleans music, including jazz, brass band, Mardi Gras Indian, rhythm and blues, funk, and hip-hop, through an intensive exposure to existing research, field trips, and occasional visits from local researchers and musicians. Musical socialization--the role of young people in extending the city's musical traditions--will be a running theme throughout the course and will connect the course materials to the optional service learning project.
