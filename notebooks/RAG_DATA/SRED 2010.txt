SRED 2010Introduction to Real Estate(3)This course is designed to provide students with the basic concepts related immovable property, including its economic and legal aspects and the development process. In addition, the course delves deeply into the unique mechanisms through which real estate has been used to perpetuate racism and resulted in serious inequalities that exist in the United States today.
The course also includes a major group project called UrbanPlan. The goal of this project is for students to deeply engage in the complex nature of city-making and the decision process that leads to our built environment and learn from each other as they play specific roles in the development team.
