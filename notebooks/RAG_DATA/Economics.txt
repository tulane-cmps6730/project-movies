We will cover both finite sample and large sample properties of OLS method, as well as the hypothesis test associated with OLS. We will also discuss the maximum likelihood method (ML), generalized least squares (GLS), endogeneity problem and its solution (instrument variable (IV)), generalized method of moments (GMM), panel data model.

Finally, we will introduce several useful time series model, such as moving average (MA) and autoregressive (AR) model.ECON 7175Econometrics III(3)This course builds somewhat on the content of PhD Econometrics I and II. The course covers methodologies that would be in any applied microeconometricians “toolbox”.

among rational (and irrational) agents. Beyond what we call 'games' in common language, such as chess, poker, soccer, etc., it includes the modeling of conflict among nations, political campaigns, competition among firms, and trading behavior in markets. This course develops the main concepts and tools of game theory with the aim to enable you to read original game-theoretic literature and to prepare you to do research in the field. The course first examines the foundations of game theory, using simple examples familiar from introductory microeconomics classes. Then, we will study how to derive equilibrium predictions for the following situations: 1) Static games of complete information; 2) Dynamic games of complete information; 3) Static games of incomplete information; and 4) Dynamic games of incomplete information.ECON 7530Adv Inc and Emp Theory I(3)A one-semester introduction to modern macroeconomic theory. The first part of the course will develop models of growth and optimal growth with alternative micro foundations.

Public finance is classically divided into taxation, expenditures, and local public finance.ECON 7680Public Finance II(3)This version of the course might be best described as one in “the role of government in markets.” Debates about the role of government increasingly center on the specific ways in which the four main forms of government involvement—expenditures/subsidies, regulation, mandates, and public provision—are designed and implemented. The optimal policy design (i.e., the optimal role of government in these four areas), in turn, depends on the characteristics of the good/service in question.ECON 7710Econ Develop.Theory I(3)This course will introduce some of the classic approaches to understanding economic development as a process and then quickly move on to examine the literature on poverty, income distribution, income determination and then look at some special issues, like education, child labor, poverty traps and structural rigidities peculiar to developing countries, and the place of women in development.ECON 7720Econ Develop.Theory II(3)This course covers the quantitative analysis of inequality and poverty measures; theories of income distribution; decomposition methods; and, the theory and practice of fiscal incidence analysis.
