Anatomy Research, MS Overview Requirements The MS Anatomy Research degree provides a program of research training for those who wish to become biomedical and medical education researchers. This is a 2-year thesis program of study of gross anatomy, embryology, cell biology, and histology leading to a Master of Science degree in Anatomy by research. It is designed specifically for candidates who wish to develop research careers in biomedical science and medical education. In the first year, students in the program take anatomy and histology courses along with other graduate courses. All courses in the program are taught within the School of Medicine by full time faculty. In the second year, students carry out mentored research in the Department of Structural and Cellular Biology. Who is this program meant for? This is a two-year  program of taught classes and laboratory research that leads to the MS Anatomy Research degree. It is designed for bachelor degree graduates and physicians who intend to follow a research career in the biomedical sciences. With a MS Anatomy Research degree, graduates can apply for laboratory research positions or to PhD programs in biomedical sciences. Program calendar The MS in Anatomy Research curriculum is designed for completion within two years. Classes start in August and end in May each year.
