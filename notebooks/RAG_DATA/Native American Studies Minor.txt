Native American Studies Minor Overview Requirements Though only 1.9% of the US population, Native Americans have played and continue to play an important part in American society.  Largely invisibilized by the foregrounding of other ethnic minority groups, Native Americans in the US struggle for recognition (federal, state, and local), for survival as cultural groups (cf.  Ile de Jean Charles evacuation/resettlement), and for basic rights (legal protections, religious freedom, education, health services, and subsistence).  Researchers at Tulane are actively involved with Native American tribes of Louisiana, working with them on issues of language and culture revitalization, displacement due to coastal erosion, health concerns and services, and equity issues.  There are many courses at Tulane that deal with Native American culture, history, and languages.  Through a structured introduction to these peoples and cultures, Tulane students can gain an appreciation for continuing contribution of these communities to the American story. Students will also have an opportunity to work closely with researchers collaborating with Native communities, learning as they contribute to projects bolstering indigenous lifeways. As Tulane is committed to increasing diversity, recognition of Native American presence, persistence and legacies (tangible and intangible) contributes to our educational mission. Mission:  To further understanding of indigenous peoples and the issues confronting their communities through engaged learning and research.
