EENS 3180Making Landscapes(3)In this course, we will explore how different "iconic" landscapes were formed such as Niagara Falls and Mount Everest.  Iconic landscapes can still be awe inspiring for those who can't see them if we are creative about how we share these landscapes.  We will also learn about best practices for teaching students with disabilities and different abilities.  As part of the class, we will teach K-12 who are visually impaired or have autism spectrum disorder about awe-inspiring landscapes using the 3D models.  Mandatory Service Learning component.
