ARCH 2021Architecture Studio(6)Second year studio concentrates on developed architectural form and design methodologies through processes of analysis, synthesis and transformation. Students work on the conceptual frameworks for their designs, with emphasis on issues of environmental context, urban design, and cultural and technological systems and their impact on architectural form. Different approaches to the making of form are investigated, along with principles of organization, such as spatial hierarchy, circulation, structure, and site relationships. Second semester will emphasize the relationship of design to cultural precedents, site conditions, programs, and material tectonics through the study of housing. Second year studios will be fully integrated with digital media classes to ensure that students gain fluency in computer aided design processes, drawing, spatial modeling and digital design techniques.
