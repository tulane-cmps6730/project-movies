MGMT 7000Leading for Success(2)Leading for Success is an intensive, experiential-oriented course that is aimed at developing four fundamental leadership skills. No matter their general mental ability, experience, or drive, leaders at any level need the same four core skills to be effective. These skills are:
-Self Awareness: Understanding your behavior's impact on organizational outcomes
-Communication: Effectively communicating goals and inspiring trust
-Influence: Being comfortable at persuading, promoting, and delegating
-Learning agility: Knowing when to change course, and helping others to do so
In this course, students will immerse themselves in development, adapt these skills to their own leadership contexts, participate with peers in learning, and share ideas on how to apply their leadership lessons to the workplace.
