BMEN 6310Continuum Models In BMEN(3)The course begins with a presentation of the kinematics of continuous media and elementary tensor manipulations. We will then cover the conservation principles of mass, linear momentum, angular momentum, and energy. Additional topics will include the formulation of constitutive laws, continuum models in electrodynamics, and simple descriptions of piezoelectric materials. These concepts will be applied to fundamental problems in bio-solid mechanics, bio-fluid mechanics, and bio-electromagnetism.Prerequisite(s):(ENGP 2430,BMEN 3440and3650) orBMEN 6650.
