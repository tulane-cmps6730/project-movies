Musical Cultures of the Gulf South Coordinate Major Overview Requirements Musical Cultures of the Gulf South is an interdisciplinary course of study that teaches students to investigate how their academic and professional goals relate to their surroundings –– a portable mindset that will enrich their lives wherever they may go. Students are educated in the underlying currents of New Orleans and the Gulf South through coursework related to the Atlantic slave trade, the rituals of expressive circum-Gulfic and circum-Caribbean culture and resistance, and the social, environmental, economic, and political history of the region. This coordinate major is offered under the auspices of the New Orleans Center for the Gulf South. All of our programs are inspired by the belief that the more we understand where we are, the more fully we can engage in our democracy and collective destiny.
