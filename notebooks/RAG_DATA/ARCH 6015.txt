ARCH 6015Architecture Studio(1)This studio is intended for students in the advanced standing M. Arch I track. Working alongside students entering the MArch I regular track, students will
expand on the tools, skills, and concepts acquired in their previous design experience, through digital drawing, 3-D modeling, and making. The goal is to instill students with the ability to navigate the digital and the physical realm fluidly by focusing on efficient digital work-flows and processes. The studio will
be structured through a series of prescribed exercises assisted by assigned readings, slide presentations, and skill instructions. Students will gain the ability to digitally model and extract 2D orthographic drawings as well as 3D print or laser-cut and assemble physical models.
