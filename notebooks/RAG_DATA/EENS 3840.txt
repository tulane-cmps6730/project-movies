EENS 3840Planetary Geophysics(3)The interior structure, composition, and dynamics of Earth and the terrestrial planets can be deduced from a number of different physical, chemical, and thermodynamic observations and models. Topics include: Early bombardment and formation of proto-planetary discs, core formation, Earth and planetary composition, thermal and density structure from seismology, gravity, and thermodynamics, geomagnetic dynamo, mantle convection, isostasy and solid Earth contributions to sea level change. Special topics for in-class seminars will explore the methodologies used to determine the internal structure (e.g., seismology, gravity), and the dynamics of systems (e.g., geomagnetism, plate tectonics, the water and carbon cycle). Assessment: 2 in-class quizzes, 6 problem sets, 2 class presentations, and a final critical review of 2 linked research papers on a special topic to be assigned in class.Prerequisite(s):PHYS 1210or1310.Corequisite(s):EENS 3841.
