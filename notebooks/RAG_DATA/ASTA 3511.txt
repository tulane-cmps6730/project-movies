ASTA 3511Intro to Chinese Linguistics(3)Introduction to Chinese Linguistics is designed to help Chinese learners understand Chinese grammar in a systematic manner as well as gain a theoretical perspective on Chinese language structure, give linguistic students a sense of how Chinese languages, in particular, Mandarin Chinese works and help (future) Chinese instructors gain the meta-linguistic knowledge in teaching Mandarin language. This course will be conducted in the form of lectures and student-led discussions. At the end of this course, students are expected to build a schema on Chinese language structure, gain a better pragmatic knowledge of Chinese language and have a better understanding of Chinese socio-cultural conventions in its language usage.
