EMPL 5410IP Issues in the Workplace(3)Intellectual property issues arise in the employment context from the moment an employee is hired, whether a full­time employee or an independent contractor. If employees create works­­—websites, inventions, newsletters, etc. within their job, additional issues will arise, both in terms of who owns the creations, but also what materials the employee is using to create those works. Copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, and right of publicity are implicated in the hiring and employing of both individuals and other companies. IP policies related to social media also are important to establish, both for the company in general, and individuals within the company, which should be communicated to employees in an effective way. Finally, situations come up where employees are using equipment at work to create after­hours creations, or are creating commercially viable creations at home. Human resources, in administering hiring documents both for employees and independent contractors should be aware of the legal issues that arise, as well as the policy behind the choices.
