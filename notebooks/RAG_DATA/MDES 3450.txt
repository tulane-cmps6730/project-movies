MDES 3450Brand & Campaign Strategy(3)This course is designed to introduce students to the foundations of building memorable brands and effective campaigns. We’ll address the core values of brand development, from brand creation to rebrands; as well as building and maintaining relationships with the consumer, while managing client expectations. Students will examine the elements involved in campaign development from planning and budgeting, to executing and managing campaigns. This course sits on the line where creativity and feasibility meet: how to tell a story in its most effective and authentic way, while accounting for not only budgets and timelines, but where and how that message could be best received – thus maximizing reach, repetition and relevancy of dollars spent.Prerequisite(s):MDES 2400,DDSN 2103andMDES 2401.
