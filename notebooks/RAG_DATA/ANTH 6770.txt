ANTH 6770Global Vietnam(3)In this class, we draw on a variety of resources—historical essays, short
stories, ethnographic essays, memoirs, and videos—in order to gain a better understanding of how refugees, migrants, and their children are forging their sense of self in order to become Vietnamese anew in places far from their presumed geographic home. We will use global Vietnamese communities as case-studies to explore theoretical concepts around critical refugee studies, diaspora, and transnationalism.
