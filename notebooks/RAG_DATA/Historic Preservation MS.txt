Historic Preservation, MS Overview Requirements The Masters of Science in Historic Preservation trains students to become leaders in the field of historic preservation and its allied disciplines. A comprehensive four-semester program provides students with the knowledge and skills to succeed in this dynamic and interdisciplinary field. The first two semesters provide training in the foundational elements of preservation practice in the 21 st century, including coursework in the history and theory of the discipline, regional and national architecture, preservation law, architectural conservation, and historic building investigation and documentation. Year two provides students with the opportunity to specialize in various areas of historic preservation including: digital technology, heritage resilience and sustainability, and architectural conservation. The program culminates in a thesis or practicum. Ultimately the program exposes students to the breadth of historic preservation in the US and International contexts. Using New Orleans as a laboratory, one that is linked to the wider Gulf Coast and Caribbean region, students are trained in an incomparable context for challenges that cross-cut historic preservation from issue in climate change, heritage justice, and housing affordability. In addition to the MS, students may apply to and concurrently complete master degrees in either Architecture (M.Arch) or Sustainable Real Estate Development (MSRED). Students can also specialize through the certificate program in Sustainable Real Estate Development (SRED).
