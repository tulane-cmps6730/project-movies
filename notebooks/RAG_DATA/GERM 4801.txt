GERM 4801Orient und Okzident:  Interkulturelle Begegnungen Im Mittelalter Und Der Frühen Neuzeit(3)This course will examine medieval and early modern travel accounts in the German-speaking world from ca. 1200-1800 CE. Using a blend of primary and secondary sources in literature (including journals, theater, poetry) and visual sources (maps, costume books, material objects) we will explore the concepts of “East” and “West” and the development of stereotypes in the representation of foreign peoples and places.
