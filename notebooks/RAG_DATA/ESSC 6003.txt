ESSC 6003Geospatial Information Systems(3)Applied Geographic Information Systems (GIS) is designed to provide students with a solid foundation in both GIS concepts and the use of GIS. Applied Geographic Information Systems strikes a careful balance between GIS concepts and hands-on applications. GIS is an emergent technological domain utilized by all U.S. Federal Departments and Agencies and many private sector organizations for defense and national security (including intelligence), transportation and logistics, and telecommunications practical application and analysis. GIS allows you to use satellite imagery to conduct geospatial analysis by using data to build maps and graphs. This course is an introductory geospatial intelligence analysis course that will provide the learner with basic technological and industry-relevant skills (no technical background required). The learner will utilize industry software to develop maps and map layers to address multiple real-world practical case studies.
