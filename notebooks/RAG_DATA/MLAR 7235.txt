MLAR 7235Women in Global Societies(3)This course engages with transnational, postcolonial, Black, and Chicana feminist theories to examine how different sociopolitical contexts intersect with women’s experiences around the world. In particular, we consider how place, nationality, sexuality, religion, culture, and class impact women’s everyday lives while analyzing how women navigate and challenge dominant social structures. Course topics will focus on the experiences of women in relation to identity, migration, representation, and economic development.
