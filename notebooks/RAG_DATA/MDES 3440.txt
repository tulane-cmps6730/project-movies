MDES 3440Project Management for Advertising(3)This course is designed to expose students to the ways in which an advertising agency functions, specifically how work flows through it and how various roles impact agency output. Working and collaborating with others is part and parcel of the strategic communications industry and understanding the process will help students understand the value that each member of the team brings to the campaign’s success. Exploring the role that both the traffic and production departments play in an agency or campaign setting will further students’ grasp of the dynamic between the various departments.Prerequisite(s):MDES 2400andDDSN 2103.
