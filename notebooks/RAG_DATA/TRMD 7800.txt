TRMD 7800Advanced Medical Entomology(3)This advanced course applies the most current knowledge in vector biology to the study of arthropods and diseases they transmit. It meets twice a week: a 2hr30´ classroom session (a lecture and in-class activities) followed by a 2h30´ lab session, in which students reinforce classroom learnings with practical experience in performing bioassays; bioinformatic, ecological, behavioral and surveillance experiments; computer and video simulations, and metabolomics. Drawing from current, primary literature and discipline-specific guidelines, students also write and present a research proposal on a topic of interest. Primary and guest instructors, which include vector biologists and biochemists from local, regional and national institutions, reflect diverse identities. This unique structure makes the course well-suited for anyone interested in vector-borne research and disease control.Prerequisite(s):TRMD 6060*.*May be taken concurrently.
