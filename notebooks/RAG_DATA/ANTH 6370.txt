ANTH 6370Locating Southeast Asia(3)As one of the most diverse regions in the world, Southeast Asia confounds easy characterization. This course introduces students to the extraordinary diversity of Southeast Asian peoples, cultures, and political economy. We will locate the region through a comparative survey as well as through interdisciplinary and ethnographic inquiries that explore key elements of the region, including livelihoods, family ties, middle class aspirations, literature and music, rapid urbanization, economic transformations, and ecological challenges.
