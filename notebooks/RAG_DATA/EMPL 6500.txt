EMPL 6500Employee Medical Leaves(2)An employee comes to you with a doctor’s note asking for time off from work.  Sounds simple, right?  Not really.  That request could be covered by the Family and Medical Leave Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act, your state’s workers’ compensation law, your policies, and more. In this class you will learn how to navigate the often-overlapping legal requirements for medical leave and reinstatement issues.  You will also learn how to discuss and document key decisions about the leave in a way that minimizes the risk of litigation.
