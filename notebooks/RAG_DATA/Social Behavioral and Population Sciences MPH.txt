Social, Behavioral, and Population Sciences, MPH Overview Requirements The MPH program in the Department of Social, Behavioral, and Population Sciences provides advanced training and field applications in basic and applied public health program development, evaluation, and research to promote health equity. Our mission is to define and address the societal and structural bases of health inequities. The program has a strong emphasis on social determinants of health and theoretically based multi-level models of health promotion. The program prepares individuals for further graduate training or professional practice where graduates progress to careers in national and international government agencies (i.e., the Centers for Disease Control and state health departments), global nonprofit organizations, public health institutes, and academia. Graduates are expected to have responsibilities that would include program leadership, planning and evaluation, and applied research. MPH in Social, Behavioral and Population Health Competencies: Construct multilevel models of health behaviors for health promotion interventions and research based on individual, community, and population level theories. Plan research and evaluation strategies to answer key social behavioral science research questions and evaluate programming, with a community-informed lens. Apply appropriate data management and analysis methods for social behavioral science research in the social determinants of health, health systems, and health policy to promote health equities and reduce health disparities. Formulate implications for research, policy, and practice from an interpretation of the results of social behavioral science research at the individual, community, and societal levels. Assess health inequities in the U.S. and globally through applying a social justice framework. Appraise one's own implicit biases and make a plan for minimizing their potential impact on personal and professional interactions.
