Architecture, M.Arch Overview Requirements The professional Master of Architecture degree program (M.Arch) is accredited by the National Architectural Accrediting Board (NAAB) and is open to students with a baccalaureate degree in any field from an accredited college or university. The M.Arch program fulfills the professional degree requirements leading to architectural licensure and registration. Two distinct tracks (3.5 years and 2 years) accommodate students’ diverse undergraduate backgrounds. 3.5-year track The 3.5-year track is structured for students with an accredited baccalaureate degree in any field. The seven-semester curriculum begins with a summer semester, followed by six semesters that include core instruction to fulfill NAAB requirements in addition to elective studios and seminars. 2-year track (advanced standing) The 2-year track provides an accelerated path for students with substantial architectural education. Those with a pre-professional degree such as a Bachelor of Science in Architecture or a Bachelor of Environmental Design, or international students with a terminal architecture degree in their respective country who wish to work towards licensure in the US and Canada should apply to this track to gain advanced standing within the M.Arch program. The Director of Graduate Architecture determines the level of advanced standing based on students’ college transcripts and design portfolio strength. Typically, students will complete the curriculum in four semesters, which include core instruction to fulfill NAAB requirements in addition to elective studios and seminars. International students with license to practice architecture or eligible for licensure in their respective countries may qualify for further advanced standing to complete the degree in three semesters. Dual degree options Graduate students may pursue a Master of Architecture degree in conjunction with a Master of Preservation Studies or Master of Sustainable Real Estate degree, typically with one additional semester of course work. Learn more on the Dual Degree page on the School of Architecture's website, or by the contacting Program Directors of Architecture , Historic Preservation or Real Estate Development .
