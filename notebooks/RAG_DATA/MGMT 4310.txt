MGMT 4310Cases in Hospitality(3)The hospitality sector has rapidly evolved in recent years, opening new space for discussions about the future of the industry.  This “high touch” course combines case study pedagogical methodology with experiential learning to take students out of the classroom and into lobbies, kitchens, and C-suites of the hospitality profession.  Cases in Hospitality offers students the unique opportunity to engage in real-time conversations with peers and experts from the Tulane community and beyond.  Students will support their coursework by applying their knowledge and experiences to various areas of the industry, examining the innovations and accommodations which occurred throughout periods of disruption and strategizing future directions.  By participating in relevant and engaging discussions, students will discover a variety of perspectives and build connections with their fellow participants from across the industry.  Throughout the duration of the course, student teams will engage in a real-time consulting project with an industry participant.  With an underlying mandate for value creation, students will gain inside access to what companies are facing on the ground, providing invaluable experience for future industry leaders.Prerequisite(s):MGMT 3010.
