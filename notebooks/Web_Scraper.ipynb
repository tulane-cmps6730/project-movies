Through a comprehensive, industry-endorsed curriculum which requires 30 credit hours, students develop analytical skills and acquire the professional expertise to take on the challenges of a professional accounting career. The MACCT program offers two-semester and three-semester options, the latter of which allows time for students who begin their studies in the fall to complete a summer internship.\n",
      "Freeman also offers a five-year joint Bachelor of Science in Management/Master of Accounting (BSM/MACCT) program. This course of study is designed to give students the knowledge, skills and preparation to immediately enter the accounting profession following graduation. In just five years, students graduate with two degrees, eligibility to sit for the CPA exam in the jurisdictions of their choice, and the confidence and expertise to become an accounting professional.\n",

However, they may elect to become eligible if they wish. In this case, they would work closely with their MACCT faculty adviser to develop an appropriate program plan. The final determination of whether a CPA exam applicant meets the educational qualifications necessary to sit for the exam in any given U.S. state or territory resides solely with the Board of Accountancy in that state or territory. All State Boards of Accountancy require evaluation and approval of a candidate’s academic credentials prior to sitting for the exam. See the National Association of State Boards of Accountancy (NASBA) website athttps://nasba.org/for more details including links to the state/territory jurisdictions as well as services that provide academic evaluations of coursework and credentials. Students who do not have an undergraduate business degree may need to take additional courses to qualify to sit for the CPA exam.\n",

Requirements for the tax major and all specializations within the MACCT program follow. Students may not count the same course for multiple specializations. However, if a course is required for two specializations, students may substitute the required course with another approved course for the second specialization.

      "Major: Aging Studies, PhD\n",
      "Content:\n",
      "Our program focuses on the processes of aging at the individual and societal level. It examines how people change over the adult life course, the interrelationships between older people and social institutions, and the societal impact of the changing age-composition of the population. We emphasize the dynamic interplay between the aging of individuals and their changing biomedical, social, and physical environments and multi-level interactions among psychological, physiological, genetic, social, and cultural domains. Our goal is integration and synthesis within and across these domains. Our faculty’s teaching and research emphasizes molecular, cellular, animal and human studies and takes place in a wide range of disciplinary and departmental settings across all of the schools at the university. Our students and faculty provide the foundation for this enterprise, working to create a new generation of leaders in this interdisciplinary field who will assume key positions in academia and in the public and private sectors. The program facilitates both basic and translational research allowing program participants to design and develop working models or implement a process that will initiate viable products or services for older adults in the expanding global community.\n",
      "The Interdisciplinary Ph.D. Program in Aging Studies was established in 2009, in response to a call by the Provost’s Office for interdisciplinary Ph.D. programs issued in 2008. The Program conforms to applicable University policies and regulations. The first class of students matriculated in the fall of 2010. Our Program is university-wide, encompassing all the Schools at Tulane University, and it is located in the School of Medicine. On successful completion of all program requirements, the student is awarded the “Doctor of Philosophy in Aging Studies.” The University funds student stipends and provides tuition waivers.\n",
      "A PhD degree can only be earned by performing original and significant research that is suitable for publication in a peer-reviewed journal, in addition to any other program requirements. It cannot be earned by fulfillment of course requirements or residence for any specific period of time. We take courses to prepare us to begin to assimilate the latest findings, often prior to publication, in a variety of disciplines. Research seminars provide this new information, and they are not designed to be general in nature. An aspiring scholar must show sufficient curiosity to participate. Research seminars do not distract from research; they enhance it, which becomes only evident to a more advanced scholar. Research is a full-time activity (24/7). It involves sustained, hard work, great dedication, creativity, intellect, knowledge, and luck. One learns how to perform research by doing it under the guidance of a master, to whom the student serves as an apprentice. The PhD degree is bestowed only when the faculty determine that a student deserves the high honor of joining the fellowship of scholars, a life-long appointment that carries with it great responsibility to oneself, to the fellowship, to the university, and to society.\n",
      "The Interdisciplinary Ph.D. Program in Aging Studies is comprised of graduate students and faculty from eight schools at Tulane University and includes the Schools of Science and Engineering, Medicine, Public Health and Tropical Medicine, Liberal Arts, Social Work, Business, Law, and Architecture. The curriculum is designed to prepare students for successful careers in existing and emerging fields related to aging. Core courses include a two-semester Introductory Seminar on Aging, Topics in Aging Research, a biomedical course, a psychosocial course, and two semesters of research methods. Students also take specialized elective courses, while performing research, beginning in the first year of the Program. All course work is completed in two years, allowing the students to concentrate full time on research from their third year on.\n",
      "Each student is guided closely by an academic advisor and co-advisor to facilitate integration across disciplinary domains, and by a dissertation committee. To obtain the Ph.D., each student passes a written preliminary examination following completion of course work at which time the student advances to candidacy for the Ph.D. degree. Students prepare a dissertation research proposal, under guidance of the dissertation committee, then submit and defend orally a dissertation based on their own original research contribution to the field.\n",

The emphasis in first-year design focuses on developing a fundamental understanding of formal, spatial and material principles in architecture, while obtaining a strong skill base in freehand drawing, descriptive geometry, material techniques, and visual and digital media. First-year electives allow students to supplement their background in physics or calculus, begin or advance foreign language study, broaden their skills in the arts, or choose any other subject area from among dozens offered by the university’s undergraduate divisions. In their first semester, students may also participate in one of the many TIDES (Tulane InterDisciplinary Experience) courses offered by the university to engage other students and faculty in an intimate, interactive environment.\n",
      "Second and third-year courses cover the majority of the program requirements. Intensive studio work in architectural design is complemented by study in architectural history and theory, structures, technological systems, digital media and urban studies. In second-year, students are fully immersed in digital design techniques while learning to incorporate knowledge from historic, environmental, social, programmatic and technological studies into the design studio. This is followed by third-year, where, in the second semester, coordinated coursework allows students a truly synthetic experience in the integrated design of a complex architectural project.\n",

Advanced Specialization Electives are typically selected from the following list:• Any 3000-level or above CENG, BMEN, CHEM, CMPS, COSC, ENGP, MATH, MPEN, or PHYS• CELL 3030: Molecular Biology• CELL 3750: Cell Biology (pre-req: CELL 3030)• EENS 4250: Isotopes in the Environment• EENS 4360: Environmental Geochemistry (pre-req: EENS 2110)• ENRG 4100: Energy Markets, Economics, and Policy• ENRG 4110: Energy Financial Modeling• ENRG 4200: Energy Fundamentals and Trading• SPHU 3160: Biostatistics in Public Health (pre-req: SPHU 1010 and 1020)• SPHU 4160: Intro to Statistical Packages (pre-req: SPHU 3160)• SPHU 4400: Practical Bioinformatics• SPHU 4410: Data & Information Management in Public Health (pre-req: SPHU 1010 and 1020)Any Substitutions must follow the Petition for Degree Plan Modification process.Technical electives, Engineering electives, and Advanced Specialization electives must each satisfy a minimum of 6 credit hours, and at least 3 credit hours of Technical and Engineering electives must be at the 3000-level or above. For all electives, the courses must be of at least the same technical rigor as the first freshman-level course we require from that department (i.e., General Chemistry for CHEM courses, General Physics for PHYS courses, Calculus I for MATH courses. CELL 1010 is the benchmark for CELL courses). Additionally, courses containing significant overlap with core curriculum are excluded (list found here). Students are encouraged to inquire with their CBE Advisor or the Undergraduate Committee Chair if they are unsure about a potential elective. Note that a maximum of 3-credit hours can be satisfied from Professional Development Courses. Courses for non-science majors will not fulfill the elective requirements.**Students may take courses from a biochemistry series offered by either Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering (CENG 4450 and 4460) or Chemistry (CHEM 3830 and 3840) to satisfy one or both courses of the Advanced Specialization Elective requirement. Once a biochemistry course has been taken and a grade of D- or better has been granted, the parallel course from the other department cannot be taken to satisfy any elective requirement for the Chemical Engineering degree. As an example, a student who withdraws from CHEM 3830 can take CENG 4450 to satisfy the first Advanced Specialization requirement. If the student then goes on to earn credit for both CENG 4460 and CHEM 3840, one of the courses can be used for elective credit but the other ‘biochemistry II’ course will not be counted as an elective, technical or otherwise.\n",

      "The City, Culture, and Community (CCC) doctoral program is a broad-based and integrative graduate education-research program that addresses relationships among the physical environment, the built environment, and social, economic, and political institutions and processes that shape cities and metropolitan regions. The intellectual focus of the CCC program is unique in bringing together interdisciplinary approaches in the social sciences, social work, architecture, law, and humanities and applying them to understand a range of issues pertaining to cities, cultures, and communities. CCC's breadth of interdisciplinary study allows students considerable flexibility to tailor their training to individual research interests while providing some depth of disciplinary training in the tracks that individual students follow: sociology, social work, and urban studies. Students must complete 53 hours of course work comprised of 24 hours of elective credits and 29 hours of required credits. For more information about the program, please consult theCCC Graduate Student Handbook.\n",
      "The CCC curriculum and research training give students an interdisciplinary conceptual and practical basis to study the dynamics of urban, cultural, and community change in international and comparative terms and frameworks. By interconnecting interdisciplinary and disciplinary education and training, CCC faculty members encourage graduate students to select dissertation topics that offer the potential for a cross-disciplinary approach with the Ph.D. degree awarded in “Sociology – CCC,” “Social Work – CCC,” or “Urban Studies - CCC.” The  program is designed to prepare students for professional careers in academic and non-academic settings. CCC's three principle goals are (1) to produce highly educated researchers with advanced theoretical and methodological skills and flexibility to compete in the academic, governmental, non-profit, private, and public sectors, or some combination; (2) to develop partnerships between faculty and students to extend scholarship in important areas of research, creativity, and practice to benefit the New Orleans community and society-at-large; and (3) to create new methods, theories, and innovative approaches to address the world's most challenging urban, environmental, and sustainability problems.\n",

      "The Minor in Civil Engineering -Water Resources and Environmental is available to students pursuing any undergraduate major in the School of Science and Engineering or in other Tulane schools.  In particular, students majoring in another engineering discipline may find the RCSE minor attractive as an additional skill set for the job market. Students with a major in the physical or environmental sciences might have already covered the pre- or co-requisites for the RCSE minor, making it a relatively easy addition to their expertise while matriculating at Tulane. Students majoring in the environmental sciences (e.g., EEB or EES) could strengthen their undergraduate training in water-related topics. Outside of SSE, any student interested in a career linked to environmental planning, climate change adaptations, the resilience of human and natural systems, and water utilization could benefit from this training. This umbrella includes fields as diverse as law, business, public health, and social sciences. We foresee particular links for students in the (1) Environmental Studies major (School of Liberal Arts), where strengthening their science and engineering background in the water sector would be advantageous in many career tracks, and (2) in the School of Architecture, where a program in landscape architecture and design is under development.\n",
      "The Minor in Civil Engineering - Water Resources and Engineering requires 18 credit hours from the following six courses:\n",
      "In summary, to complete the RCSE minor, students using RCSE3010 or BMEN 2320 for the fluid mechanics requirement will also need to successfully complete one semester each of calculus and physics. If using CENG23230, they will need three semesters of math (including 2 of calculus), one of physics, one of chemistry, and an additional CENG course (Thermodynamics). Likely the latter track to the RCSE minor will primarily be followed by students seeking a major in chemical engineering.\n",
      "As further requirements for the RCSE minor, students must maintain a 2.00 GPA in all minor courses. No courses can count toward a second minor in SSE or other Tulane schools.  For more information, please contact the department chair atmeadallison@tulane.edu.\n",

      "Transfer of college-level courses follows the standard Tulane credit transfer procedure. There is no special department-level limit on the number of courses that can transfer; we adhere to the limit established by Newcomb-Tulane College. In order for a course from another university to count for the coordinate major, it should match a corresponding Tulane course in content and/or complexity; mode of delivery (online, in-person, hybrid) doesn’t affect this evaluation. Computing courses on subjects not offered by Tulane might be transferrable. Students should confirm with the Department of Computer Science whether the course would transfer as a coordinate major course before registering.\n",

      "We often get asked what programming languages we teach.In fact, we teach principles, concepts, and problem-solving approaches rather than specific languages.CMPS 1500 is in Python.CMPS 1600 uses Java, C, C++, Haskell, and a surprise language.The elective courses use a language that’s necessary to achieve the tasks of the course (e.g.Javascript, Scala, Ruby).Our successful students get used to learning new languages and are able to study the basics of any computer language on their own.\n",
      "Another common area of inquiry is about buying a computer.It is helpful and convenient to have a laptop.We don’t have a computer lab, and students work on their own laptops to complete most programming assignments.Model and make don’t matter; any modern laptop with Wi-Fi and a battery works.If buying or bringing a laptop is problematic, all necessary work can be done on university stationary computers or loaner laptops.It is possible to do well in all computer science courses without owning a computer.\n",

      "The Master's Program in Computer Science is offered in coursework and thesis tracks. The coursework option requires both breadth and depth requirements. The breadth requirement ensures students obtain a solid foundation in core computer science areas, while the depth requirement allows students to design a sequence of courses to target a particular area of interest. The thesis track further allows students to conduct research in a chosen area of interest. The Master’s degree can also be pursued in a 4+1 format in conjunction with the Coordinate major in Computer Science.\n",
      "The M.S. program requires 30 credit hours of graduate coursework. Coursework requirements vary slightly depending on the chosen track, but consist of 12 credits of breadth coursework and 12-18 credits of depth coursework. Below we outline these degree tracks with their associated course requirements and provide some example curricula. We note that some of these example curricula do not have full-time enrollment in all semesters. Additional electives can be added in these slots as needed for full-time requirements.\n",
      "At the high level, the course requirements for the M.S. can be thought of as having acore requirementand anelective requirement. The core requirement is identical to that of our Ph.D. program, which requires of one core course from each of three breadth areas (Algorithms, Systems and Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning), for a total of three courses counting for 9 credit hours. Currently the Algorithms area requirement is fulfilled byCMPS 6610Algorithms (3 c.h.)(Algorithms), the Systems area is fulfilled byCMPS 6750Computer Networks (3 c.h.)orCMPS 6760Distributed Systems (3 c.h.)(Distributed Systems), and the AI/ML area requirement is fulfilled byCMPS 6620Artificial Intelligence (3 c.h.)(Artificial Intelligence) orCMPS 6720Machine Learning (3 c.h.)(Machine Learning). The available degree tracks are thecoursework,projectandthesistracks; each of these can also be completed in the 4+1 format for existing coordinate majors.\n",

      "The objective of the program is to ensure students obtain a solid foundation by requiring them to take graduate courses in a number of core areas of computer science. A depth requirement involving the attendance of a sequence of courses from one or more areas will enable the student to acquire world-class expertise on a research area of concentration. Students also will be expected to engage in research as early as their incoming semester. This will be accomplished by the research courses and research seminars that will prepare students by engaging them in research from the start.\n",
      "More detailed information about the PhD program can be found on the following program page:https://sse.tulane.edu/cs/academics/graduate/phd-programs.\n",
      "The program requires 48 credit hours of graduate course work, including core computer science courses, research courses starting in the first year, as well as an interdisciplinary research project. After an oral qualifying examination at the end of the fifth semester, the prospectus presentation is scheduled at the beginning of the seventh semester, and the final milestone is to complete and defend a dissertation.\n",
      "Course requirements are broken down into four areas: core courses, research courses, the interdisciplinary project and electives. Students are required to complete at least 48 credit hours (typically 16 classes) of coursework. This consists of:\n",
      "Each student is required to devise a schedule of courses in consultation with their faculty advisor.\n",
      "As a breadth requirement that ensures a good foundation in graduate Computer Science coursework, each PhD student is required to take one class (3 credit hours) in each of the three categories below with a grade point average of at least 3.5 for these three courses. Courses in which an inadequate grade is received may be repeated once. These courses are from the following core areas:\n",
      "The core courses have to be completed before the student's oral qualifying exam.\n",
      "Students are expected to engage in research early on, possibly as early as their incoming semester, but no later than the third semester. This is facilitated through research courses, as well as through the interdisciplinary project. Students are required to take at least three research classes (9 credit hours). Typically, these classes consist ofCMPS 7010Research Seminar (3 c.h.)in the first year, and one offering ofCMPS 7020Research in Computer Science (3 c.h.)in the second year.CMPS 7010Research Seminar (3 c.h.)introduces students to research methods in Computer Science and to the research conducted in the department. In theCMPS 7020Research in Computer Science (3 c.h.)course PhD students engage in a research project in Computer Science, under the direction of a faculty member, normally the student's faculty advisor.\n",
      "Each student is required to complete an interdisciplinary research project. The project is directed by a faculty member in Computer Science, and it consists of interdisciplinary research in a related area. During the rst-year research seminar classes, students are exposed to the research areas represented by the department faculty. Students are encouraged to identify a faculty advisor and a research topic for their interdisciplinary project during these seminar classes. If a student is unable to identify a project, the Graduate Studies Committee assigns a faculty mentor to advise the student and help develop an interdisciplinary project. The requirements for the interdisciplinary project are:\n",
      "Typically, students are exposed to interdisciplinary research during their first year in research seminar classes. They start the interdisciplinary project in their third semester, and the expectation is that the project is completed by the end of the second year.\n",
      "The following elective courses are part of the PhD requirements:\n",
      "The student's faculty advisor and PhD committee oversee the research portion of the student's PhD program.\n",
      "Since students are expected to conduct directed research early in the program, they are encouraged to identify a faculty advisor and their dissertation research topic as soon as possible but no later than the end of their second year. The advisor often will be the faculty member advising the student on the interdisciplinary research project. Once a student selects a faculty advisor for their dissertation, that advisor serves as the main point of contact for the student.\n",
      "During the student's fourth semester, the student and the faculty advisor draft a proposed list of members of the student's PhD committee. The proposed committee must be approved by the Graduate Studies Committee. Initially, the PhD committee consists of at least three faculty members: the Computer Science faculty advisor and two additional faculty members. One committee member may be a Tulane faculty member from outside the Computer Science department, as appropriate. This committee administers the qualifying oral examination, attends the prospectus presentation and approves the written prospectus, and attends the thesis defense. During the summer before the student's third year, a fourth member of the committee is recruited. This member must be external to Tulane. The external committee member must attend the student's prospectus presentation, approve the written thesis and attend the thesis defense. The PhD Committee provides advice and guidance throughout the student's course of study, oversees the qualifying exam, the prospectus, and the dissertation defense.\n",
      "Major milestones of the PhD program are the oral qualifying exam and the prospectus, including the prospectus presentation.\n",
      "The oral qualifying exam typically takes place in the the fifth semester, administered by the PhD committee. Before taking the oral qualifying exam the student must have completed the core requirements as well as the interdisciplinary project. The PhD committee compiles a reading list the student is responsible for in the oral qualifying exam. The purpose of this exam is to ensure the student is qualified to do independent research. The student is tested over a set of selected topics related to the student's research area. The student is informed about the material covered on the exam during the semester preceding the exam. The exam may start with a short presentation by the student and is followed by questions from the committee. The oral qualifying exam must be passed before the end of the fifth semester; it can be retaken at most once.\n",
      "At the beginning of the student's seventh semester, the PhD committee { the original three members and the external fourth member { attend an oral prospectus presentation given by the student. In the presentation, the student describes the central problem that will be addressed in the dissertation, including the background needed to place the problem properly in perspective. The purpose of the presentation is to give the student feedback about the proposed problem and to suggest additional issues that may be relevant to the proposed research. A final written prospectus of 3-5 pages in length that describes the proposed PhD research must be approved by the PhD committee and submitted to the School of Science and Engineering, no later than the end of the semester in which the prospectus presentation takes place.\n",
      "After passing the oral qualifying exam, a student focuses primarily on research in a particular area in which they have chosen to do their dissertation research, participating in research projects overseen by their advisor. In many cases, the student co-authors papers in conferences and journals about the research results obtained during these research activities. Then the dissertation will comprise a compilation of the results, with the expectation that the student utilizes the dissertation to present the material as a coherent theme. A draft of the thesis must be circulated to the PhD committee at least one month before the final version is due in the School of Science and Engineering, and the committee will render a verdict on whether the dissertation meets the standards to be accepted for the PhD degree.\n",

It requires independent study in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology (EBIO 6910, 6920) or Environmental Biology (EBIO 7150, 7160), or an internship with an approved off-campus agency (EBIO 7660, 7670). These components distinguish this terminal degree program from the thesis-based master's degree in EEB. The opportunity to undertake independent study or to accrue on-the-job training with a governmental or private agency through an internship lends a unique character to this program and may give graduates an employment advantage.\n",
      "Applications and admissions for the 4+1 programs are rolling - applications are encouraged at any time of the year. Tulane undergraduate students are encouraged to talk with faculty about the 4+1 program during their junior year and may begin to take graduate level classes during their senior year, but should only apply formally during their senior year. By the end of the junior year (or at the time of application), candidates should have completed all LAS proficiency and distribution requirements for the B.S. degree and all core requirements for the major. Candidates are required to have a minimum 3.0 cumulative GPA and EEB GPA. To advance to the fifth (graduate) year, candidates must complete all requirements for the B.S. degree in EEB by the end of their senior year, while maintaining the minimum 3.0 cumulative and EEB GPAs. Teaching assistantships are not available to students pursuing this master's degree program.\n",

During the senior year, two 6000- or 7000-level courses (6 credits), chosen in consultation with the graduate faculty advisor, may be completed toward both the bachelor's degree and the M.S. degree in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology. In some cases, students wishing to advance their work on the graduate component so as to devote more time to independent study or internship courses in the fifth year may petition the EEB Department to count as many as 12 credits of 6000- or 7000-level courses toward the graduate component. The six additional dual credits must be completedin excess of the 120 required for the bachelor's degree, giving the student a total of 126 credits or greater upon receiving the bachelor's degree.\n",

Our cross campus partners include the Freeman School of Business, the Stone Center for Latin American Studies, the School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine, the Cowen Institute for Public Education Initiatives, the Department of Political Science, and the Murphy Institute of Political Economy.

Generous fellowships are available and are awarded on the basis of academic merit and potential for scholarship. Accepted students receive funding for five years, conditional on satisfactory progress through the program.\n",

      "A NOTE ON RESIDENCE REQUIREMENTS: Students should expect to complete the PhD program in five years and yet they will typically finish taking classes in the first half of that time.  The dissertation-writing phase thus accounts for at least half of the program. This is a very important, formative time when students mature as professional economists. They interact with the faculty, learn to teach and perform research by working with faculty members as RA’s or TA’s, present their own work in workshops and seminars, travel to conferences, participate in departmental seminars, and meet with visiting speakers. Students who choose to leave during this period typically never complete the PhD degree. It is therefore expected that all PhD students will remain in residence in New Orleans during this very important and formative period. Leaving New Orleans without obtaining explicit written approval from the student’s dissertation advisor and from the Director of Graduate Studies will constitute grounds for terminating financial support permanently.Any such written approval must be obtained by the end of the first month of the semester before the intended absence.\n",

      "Students in the 4+1 M.A. program will complete the normal undergraduate French major comprising 33 hours (15 hours of core courses and 18 hours of advanced courses). In their senior year (4th year), students will take 12 credits in French (four 6000-level classes or three 6000-level plus one 7000-level seminar). These 12 credits will then also be counted towards the 33 hours required for the 4+1 M.A. in French.\n",

      "Content:\n",
      "From Old French to Louisiana Creole, from codex to hypertext, graduate study at Tulane fosters a comprehensive and integrative approach to French Studies. With an international faculty covering a broad range of research and teaching interests, our program allows students to choose from a rich array of courses and encourages them to approach the study of language, literature and civilization through transhistorical and cross-cultural perspectives. This kind of comparative engagement provides students with intellectual depth and interdisciplinary dynamism.\n",
      "Students at Tulane have unique opportunities for exploring the French, Creole, and Cajun cultures of Louisiana. Our location affords us a privileged vantage point from which to observe other situations of localized or marginalized languages and cultures in their relationship to broader, often hegemonic forces: France’s regional languages (Occitan, Breton, Alsatian, etc.) in conflict with the official language revered as an inviolable symbol of national unity; immigrant cultural practices (such as the wearing of the veil) in conflict with French cultural norms; creole languages stigmatized as corrupt forms of the standard, etc. In our various fields of research, a focus on the local provides both a revealing lens through which to view the global and a healthy check on universalizing theories of culture and language.\n",
      "The program’s areas of strength include Francophone, Afro-Caribbean, and Mediterranean studies, medieval and early modern studies, cultural studies and cultural history, critical theory, political theory, gender studies, film theory, creole linguistics, European and African philosophy, performance studies and poetics.\n",
      "Financial support includes full tuition remission and a stipend for up to five years of Ph.D. study (four years for students entering with the M.A. degree). The stipend is approximately $26,000.\n",
      "To apply, please go to:https://applygrad.tulane.edu/apply/\n",
      "The Ph.D. builds on a solid core of course work in French Studies and includes as well a concentration in an interdisciplinary subfield that may be fulfilled entirely or in part through courses taken in other departments or programs. The degree is interdisciplinary and integrative, drawing on diverse fields for a broad methodological base.\n",
      "Students must complete a minimum of 54 credit hours, including transfer work and work already presented for the M.A. degree. For students entering with a B.A., it is expected that course work will be completed by the beginning of the third year of study. Students will graduate with a Ph.D. in French Studies and a concentration in one of five integrated areas:\n",
      "Students entering the program with the M.A. should declare their concentration at the end of their second semester on campus. B.A. students who will be continuing on to the Ph.D. should inform the Graduate Director of their choice of concentration when completing the M.A degree.\n",
      "Concentration in one of the four subfields will be constituted by successful completion of two graduate courses on topics related to the subfield. Students are also expected to demonstrate knowledge of their chosen field of concentration in the Ph.D. qualifying exams. One or both of the required courses may be taken in correlate departments or programs. Each semester, students at the Ph.D. level are allowed to take at most one course outside the Department of French and Italian.\n",
      "French 6050 (“Teaching French”) and French 6150 (“Critical Theory”) are required of all students and must be taken in the first semester that they are offered after the student enters the program.\n",
      "Beyond the 3 credits of 7000-level courses required for the M.A., doctoral candidates who begin the program with a B.A. must complete two additional 7000-level courses (that is, 6 credits of seminar-level courses). Students entering the program with an M.A. from another institution must complete two 7000-level courses in the Tulane program.\n",
      "During the course of their graduate study, Ph.D. students cannot take more than 3 hours (1 course) in independent study. Independent studies courses are approved only in exceptional cases; students are encouraged to fulfill their course requirements through regularly scheduled courses.\n",
      "For students entering the program with a B.A., two of three written Ph.D. preliminary exams will be taken in the Spring semester of the student’s third year, no later than two weeks before the end of classes. The specific date will be determined on an annual basis by the Graduate Advisor. The third, self-designed, exam will be taken in the second full week of classes of the Fall semester of the student’s fourth year.\n",
      "Students entering the program with an M.A. will take their first two exams in the Spring semester of their second year, no later than two weeks before the end of classes. The specific date will be determined on an annual basis by the Graduate Advisor. These students will take the third, self-designed, exam in the second full week of classes of the Fall semester of their third year.\n",
      "In the first week of the Fall semester prior to the semester in which the student plans to take the first two exams, they must notify the Director of Graduate Studies. The Director of Graduate Studies will then contact the student’s prospective dissertation advisor, who will serve as head of the examining committee and will select two additional readers.\n",
      "Students will sit for three written examinations and an oral examination. The oral examination will normally take place in the week following the first two written exams. All three written exams are take-home and open-book. The questions for the written exams normally will be made available to the student on a Friday morning at 9:00 a.m., and the answers must be submitted electronically to the examining committee by 5:00 p.m. of the following Monday. It is expected that the answers be both synthetic and analytical, and that they demonstrate familiarity with the primary and secondary texts on the reading list independently of recourse to lengthy quotation and paraphrase. All sources consulted must be duly cited.\n",
      "For each written exam, the student will answer either one or two questions. Students will normally write from 3500 to 4200 words (i.e., 10 to 12 pages in 12-point Times New Roman font with one-inch page margins) for each exam. If an exam consists of two separate questions, the 10 to 12 pages should be divided more or less evenly between them.\n",
      "The first written examination will cover a particular century. The second written examination will cover either a century or one of the four sub-fields listed above. The third, self-designed, written examination will be based on a reading list composed by the student in close consultation with their prospective dissertation director. The reading list for the self-designed exam should not significantly overlap with the reading list for either of the other two written exams and should be considered a blueprint for the dissertation bibliography.\n",
      "The oral examination will last for approximately one hour, the first twenty minutes of which will consist of the student’s analysis of a literary text. The analysis should not be read but presented extemporaneously from a copy of the primary text along with an outline or notes prepared ahead of time by the student. The remainder of the oral exam will cover the same material that was initially tested on the two written exams.\n",
      "The passage for textual analysis is chosen by the committee head in a conversation with the student in the semester prior to the examination semester. The student will not know ahead of time the precise work from which the text for analysis will be drawn, but will be provided with the text immediately upon his or her completion of the written exams.\n",
      "For all preliminary exams, the language of examination will be alternately French and English. The first exam will be written in one of those two languages and the second exam will be written in the other. The self-designed exam is to be written in the same language as the dissertation. The opening portion of the oral exam (the textual analysis and subsequent questions or comments pertaining to the analysis) will be presented in French. The remaining portion of the oral exam will be conducted primarily in French, but examiners may also ask questions in English, particularly when the reading material being tested is in English. When students announce their intention to sit for the Ph.D. exams, they should remember to inform the Director of Graduate Studies of their choice of language for each of the written exams.\n",
      "All examinations will be evaluated on a Pass/Fail basis, and a failed exam may be re-taken only once, normally within two to three weeks of the original exam. Students must pass all four exams, written and oral, in order to be admitted to candidacy. They will be informed of the result of the oral examination immediately following that exam, and they will learn of the committee’s decision regarding the first two written exams, including any need for re-takes, only after all sections of the exam (both oral and written) have been completed. Once the student has passed the self-designed exam, s/he will meet with the members of the examining committee to discuss the answer(s) to the exam and obtain guidance for writing the prospectus.\n",
      "The dissertation prospectus should be defended by December 15 of the semester in which the student sits for the self-designed exam. The prospectus is approximately 10 to 15 pages in length, including a supporting bibliography that convincingly lays the ground for subsequent dissertation research. The student should be familiar with the works listed in the bibliography and be able to explain their relevance to the research project. After summarizing the prospectus, the student will answer questions from the faculty. The prospectus is to be approved by the dissertation director (first reader) and by two other professors serving as second and third readers. All committee members and all full-time faculty of the Department of French and Italian are invited to attend the prospectus defense, which is to be held during the academic year, but not during semester finals or between semesters. The prospectus must be submitted to readers no less than two weeks before the date of the defense, with a copy left in the conference room for other faculty to read.\n",
      "Upon successful defense of the prospectus, the student should ask readers to sign the form provided by the School of Liberal Arts (http://tulane.edu/liberalarts/upload/prospectusform1.pdf).\n",
      "Students must demonstrate by examination reading competence in a second foreign language (beyond the language presented for the Master's) that is pertinent to their field of study. Students normally choose from among Arabic, Creole, Spanish, Italian, Latin, German, and medieval Occitan, but they may petition to have another language accepted if they can clearly demonstrate that it will be of significant use in their research.\n",
      "Language competence may be demonstrated by passing an examination administered by the department at Tulane in which the language is taught by standardized (ETS) examination, by official record of competence demonstrated elsewhere at the graduate level, or by satisfactory performance in a 6000- or 7000-level course taught in the language.\n",
      "In the summer, the Graduate School may offer reading-competence courses in languages for which there is adequate demand. Satisfactory performance on an exam given at the end of the course fulfills the reading-competence requirement for the degree. However, students may, if they wish, opt to take one of the external exams (as listed in the paragraph above) rather than sit for the in-course examination.\n",
      "As an alternative to demonstrating competence in this second foreign language (actually a fourth language, beyond French, English, and a third language for the M.A.), students may elect to do advanced coursework in the same language in which they demonstrated competence for the M.A. Successful completion of a graduate course requiring reading, speaking, writing, and lectures in that language will be accepted by the department in lieu of an examination in an additional language.\n",
      "Students who wish to conduct research in the early periods, as well as those who wish to pursue topics in other fields requiring special linguistic competence, are strongly urged to consult with faculty members in the relevant fields so that they may plan which languages to study.\n",
      "The oral defense of the dissertation, held after the dissertation has been approved by all three committee members (or, if necessary, by two out of the three), will be open to all members of the committee and to all full- time faculty of the Department of French and Italian.\n",

Some choose to hone their writing and editing techniques by joining one of our eight legal journals. Others compete in trial and appellate moot court teams to train in oral and written advocacy. Students acquire real-world experience in our law clinics and labs. Our clinics, Trial Advocacy course and boot camp skills-training program teach the students key skills to succeed in their future practice.\n",
      "Tulane is proud to offer six distinctive programs in which students may earn a certificate of concentration: Civil Law, International and Comparative Law, Maritime Law, Environmental Law and Sports Law.\n",
      "Beyond the certificate programs, Tulane holds core courses in alternative dispute resolution; constitutional law; consumer law; corporate and commercial law; civil law and procedure; criminal law and procedure; energy law; legal ethics and professionalism; family law; health law; labor and employment law; property and real estate law; administrative and regulatory law; state and local government procedure; tax law; and advanced legal writing. Faculty in both specialty and traditional areas of study are nationally and internationally recognized for their contributions to their fields. Upper-level students have the freedom to choose from our broad range of course offerings and can select any combination of classes.\n",
      "Tulane Law’s capacity to teach the world’s two preeminent legal systems is one of its greatest strengths. Students who intend to practice in common law jurisdictions will find the same extensive course offerings at Tulane as at other national law schools. However, Tulane offers students who plan to practice internationally or in civil law jurisdictions an assortment of civil law classes not offered at most law schools. Students may take either common or civil law courses, and many take a mix of both to expand their legal knowledge and practice potential.\n",
      "Candidates for the Juris Doctor degree must spend six full-time semesters in academic residence and complete 88 semester hours at the Law School with at least a 2.0 or C average. All candidates must successfully complete (i) the first-year curriculum, (ii) the Legal Profession course, (iii) the upper-class writing requirement, (iv) six credits of experiential learning, and (v) the 50-hour pro bono requirement.\n",

      "All students are required to take the following courses:\n",
      "Tulane offers its students the unique opportunity to take courses in the civil law system: during the Spring semester of their first year, JD students elect to complete the first-year curriculum by taking civil law courses (Civil Law Property and Obligations I) or common law courses (Common Law Property and Contracts II). All students have the option to take foundational and advanced courses in both systems as electives.\n",
      "The first-year legal research and writing program is designed to teach the fundamentals of legal writing and to acquaint the student with various research techniques utilizing the resources of the law library and computerized legal databases. Over the course of two semesters, students will learn the techniques of legal problem-solving, and learn to research and draft legal memoranda and briefs through a series of progressively more complex writing assignments. The course culminates with the drafting of an appellate brief and an oral argument before an appellate moot court.\n",
      "After their first year, J.D. students are free to design their own curriculum from an array of electives, or to concentrate their studies in an area of curricular strength advanced courses in conjunction with our certificate programs. Optional summer programs and externship opportunities are offered in New Orleans and in a variety of locations throughout the world.\n",
      "JD students must successfully complete one rigorous writing project after their first year of law school. The upper class writing requirement may be satisfied through an approved seminar or course, a directed research project supervised by a faculty member, or production under faculty supervision of a publishable case note or comment in any of our student-edited journals.\n",
      "J.D. candidates must successfully complete courses providing a minimum of six experiential learning credits. Experiential credits may be earned through participation in our traditional live-client clinics, as well as through simulation courses and externship field placements.\n",
      "Some students choose to hone their writing and editing abilities by joining one of our law journals. Others compete in trial and appellate teams in our Moot Court Program to train in oral and written advocacy.\n",
      "In addition to the academic requirements set forth above, each JD candidate must complete a total of 50 hours of approved uncompensated, law-related pro bono service.\n",

Fifteen credit hours must be in art history pertaining to areas outside Latin America. The balance of credit hours are electives; they may be in art history and/or Latin America, but they may also pertain to other areas relevant to the student’s work (e.g., European history, Medieval thought, writing systems). The Latin American Studies core seminar is required, as is a course on art historical method and/or theory. All courses must be at the 6000 and 7000 levels.\n",

Where a student's program suggests that there is an educational and qualitative logic, it is also possible to declare one synthetic concentration that combines courses from more than one department. Such a concentration might be, for example, “Cultural Studies\" or “Mexican Studies.’‘ Students are also encouraged, in consultation with the Graduate Advisor, to take courses that may fall outside of their concentration areas if such courses are critical to the development of specific research skills, tools, methods, or content necessary in the pursuit of their research agendas.\n",
      "Language Requirement\n",
      "The requirement for graduation with the M.A. in Latin American Studies is demonstrated competence in either Spanish or Portuguese. Students are expected to pass a language examination in Spanish or Portuguese during the first year of study. The required level of competence in Spanish and Portuguese corresponds to “intermediate-high’‘ on the American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Language (ACTFL) scale or the Avant STAMP 4S scale. This competency is considered a minimum requirement. Students are encouraged to develop additional languages as needed by their research fields.\n",
      "Currently, the Avant STAMP 4S examinations are administered by the Language Learning Center (https://liberalarts.tulane.edu/language-learning-center/language-testing/proficiency). Native Spanish and Portuguese speakers are exempt from this requirement, though they are still encouraged to take the examination.\n",
      "Transfer of Credit\n",
      "Upon entering the program a maximum of six graduate-level course credits (two courses) may be transferred from another department of Tulane or another University toward your Latin American Studies M.A. degree. However, students who do choose to transfer two courses will lose one semester of M.A. funding (limiting thesis writers to three semesters and non-thesis writers to two). To be considered for transfer credit toward an M.A. degree, graduate work done at another institution must carry a grade of 3.0 (on a 4.0 scale) or better and must have been completed no more than four years from the date of first registration for graduate work at Tulane.\n",
      "Acceptance of graduate credit for work done at other graduate institutions must be approved by the Stone Center for Latin American Studies and by the Dean of the School of Liberal Arts. Although the official decision concerning the acceptance of transfer credit towards the Latin American Studies M.A. degree will be made only after the student has completed one semester of successful study in the program, the Stone Center Graduate Advisor can evaluate the transferability of previous coursework before the student enters the program. If you are planning to transfer credit, remember to contact your Graduate Advisor after you have completed your first semester in the degree program so that he may recommend your credit for transfer.\n",
      "Independent Studies\n",
      "Independent Studies can be an important part of your program if used properly and sparingly. Typically an independent project is created to fill an academic need or interest that is not being met by regular disciplinary offerings or to expand upon research begun in other courses but not fully completed. Ordinarily, the Graduate Advisor will not authorize students to take more than two stand-alone Independent Study courses during the course of their M.A. degree. Students may register for the independent study directly through the Latin American Studies program; but students should first attempt to register for the independent study through the department of the sponsoring faculty member.

In each instance, prospective students must submit a formal application for admission to the Ph.D. program.\n",
      "Each semester doctoral students normally enroll in three classes and teach one class. By university regulations, students are allowed to enroll in a minimum of two courses while they serve as Teaching Assistants.\n",
      "Students also begin preparation for general preliminary examinations, which are given during students’ last semester of classes and should be taken no later than the first semester after the completion of all coursework requirements. These are normally in October or March.\n",
      "Upon satisfying the coursework and language requirements and completing the general exams, students begin research for the dissertation, presenting a formal prospectus for faculty approval. Once approved they can apply for admittance to candidacy for the doctoral degree and commence formal work on the dissertation, which must demonstrate their ability to carry out an original investigation in the field of Latin American Studies. Degrees are conferred only after the dissertation is approved in a formal defense before a faculty committee.\n",
      "Coursework and Distribution Requirements\n",
      "The minimum coursework requirement for the Ph.D. is 54 credit hours. Portions of this requirement are often satisfied by credit awarded for academic work completed in fulfilling requirements for the M.A. degree with thesis.\n",
      "Students with an M.A. in Latin American Studies from Tulane may transfer up to 30 credits of relevant work from their M.A. program, while students transferring from other departments at Tulane or other universities may transfer no more than 12 hours of relevant work (see Transfer Credit below).\n",

      "Transfer Credits\n",
      "At the time of admission, the Graduate Advisor can provide an informal assessment about what previous course credit can be transferred to meet Ph.D. requirements, but University policy allows the Graduate Advisor to make a formal evaluation of requests for transfer credit only after students have completed nine hours in residence at Tulane. After that point, and before the student accumulates a total of 42 credit hours, the Graduate Advisor recommends the transfer of appropriate and germane credit to the Graduate Dean for approval. Students seeking transfer credits should be prepared to provide copies of syllabi and/or course term papers as evidence of the relevance of the courses in question to their graduate work in their Latin American Studies program. Only courses that have a theoretical or content-specific logic to a student’s Latin American Studies academic program will be approved for transfer credit.\n",
      "As noted above, students with an M.A. (with thesis) in Latin American Studies from Tulane may transfer up to 30 credits of relevant work from their M.A. program, while students transferring from other departments at Tulane or other universities may transfer up to 12 hours of relevant coursework.\n",
      "Acceptance of graduate credit for work done in other M.A. programs at Tulane or other universities is recommended by the Graduate Advisor and approved by the Dean of the School of Liberal Arts. To be considered for transfer credit, coursework must have received a grade of 3.0 or better on a 4.0 scale and must have been completed no more than six years before the date of first registration in the Center’s doctoral program. Only in very special cases, and with the recommendation of the Stone Center’s Graduate Advisor, will the Dean consider transfer of credit for courses taken earlier.\n",
      "Language Requirements\n",
      "The language requirement for graduation with the Ph.D. in Latin American Studies is demonstrated competence in two languages. Normally, one is Spanish; the second Portuguese. However, other languages may be presented if essential for the student’s research. German, Quechua, Nahuatl, or Kaqchikel are examples. Students are expected to pass a language examination in Spanish or Portuguese during the first year of study. The required level of competence in Spanish and Portuguese corresponds to “intermediate-high’‘ on the American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Language (ACTFL) scale or the Avant STAMP 4S scale. This competency is considered a minimum requirement. Students are encouraged to develop additional languages as needed by their research fields. Levels of competency similar to those described for Spanish and Portuguese are required in any language presented to satisfy this requirement.\n",
      "Currently, language competency is determined by performance on the Avant STAMP 4S examinations, which are administered by the Language Learning Center (https://liberalarts.tulane.edu/language-learning-center/language-testing/proficiency). All students, even native speakers, must be either examined for minimal linguistic competency as explained above or certified as to their native fluency by the Spanish and Portuguese Department.\n",
      "Certification of competency in a second language must be presented by the end of the second year of study. Transfer students are expected to pass one language during the first year of study, and a second language examination by the end of second year of study. Testing in languages that are not available through the Avant STAMP 4S process in the Language Learning Center should be discussed with the Graduate Advisor to determine if such testing is possible and what would be the procedures for such testing.\n",

      "This range of courses ensures that you will receive a rigorous and broad background in linguistics, which will prepare you for your own research projects and will make you highly qualified for the job market. You should normally enroll in 12 credit hours (4 courses) per semester until you have completed the required course work for the Ph.D., which will normally take 4-5 semesters, depending on your background.

(See the university graduate requirements for more information on Tulane's residency and course-hour requirements.)\n",

Although a grade of B- is a passing grade, it is considered a \"weak\" pass. One or two B- grades can be cause for probation or dismissal. In addition to your course grades, however, the general assessment of your overall progress in the program will also include the opinions of the faculty. The faculty meets at the end of each semester to discuss graduate students' progress. Renewal of your fellowship from year to year is dependent upon continuing satisfactory progress in your studies.\n",

The general comprehensive examination is to be taken in early September of the student’s third year (fifth semester) in the program, and the special field examination is to be taken in early to mid-January of the third year (sixth semester). You may petition the program to substitute a published paper for the special field exam.\n",

      "Your first task with the dissertation committee is to write a research paper, called the dissertation prospectus. The prospectus should consist of a substantial dissertation proposal and a comprehensive bibliography. It may be based on a grant proposal to an external funding agency, particularly in the case of proposed fieldwork. The work described in the prospectus should lead naturally into your dissertation. The prospectus should contain a statement of the topic area of your proposed dissertation project, a problem statement, a statement of the theoretical orientation and methodology, and a comprehensive bibliography. Work out the specific details of your prospectus with the members of your dissertation committee. Once it is complete, you will schedule an oral defense of the prospectus before the members of your committee. The prospectus defense should take place before the end of your third year (sixth semester) in the program.\n",
      "After you have passed your comprehensive examinations and your language requirement and your dissertation committee has approved your prospectus, you will apply for Candidacy for the Ph.D. Once you have advanced, you are considered 'ABD' (All But Dissertation).

If you succeed in securing outside funding to replace your Tulane stipend for one year, you may be eligible to bank that year of stipend for use in your sixth year. If your research does not require you to absent yourself in order to pursue fieldwork, you may continue directly to writing your dissertation.\n",

      "Following advancement to candidacy, you will normally be eligible for a fifth year of financial support to work full time toward the completion of the dissertation. Receiving your final year of fellowship is contingent upon your having met the following requirements:\n",
      "Students generally find writing a dissertation to be a challenging and rewarding process. However, it is also an inherently stressful activity. For this reason, you should meet regularly with the members of your committee at every stage of your project, and keep in touch with them about data collection and writing. And finally, remember that all of the faculty members have also written a dissertation (and likely supervised a number of them too), and are happy to discuss any issues that come up for you.\n",
      "Upon completion of an acceptable draft of your dissertation, you will then, in consultation with the chair of your dissertation committee, schedule a public defense of your work. All members of the Tulane community are invited to the defense, and anyone else is welcome to attend. You should prepare a short presentation of your work, summarizing the main research question(s), how you went about doing your project, and your key findings. Your dissertation committee will then ask you questions about your dissertation, as may other members of the audience, time permitting.\n",
      "There are a host of important deadlines to keep track of, as well as very specific formatting minutia which you must strictly follow in order to file the dissertation. Consult the relevant sections ofDeadlines for Graduating Students. As always, you are ultimately responsible for being aware of and complying with all formal requirements and university deadlines. After you have submitted a complete draft of your dissertation, defended it publicly, and made any revisions suggested by your committee, you are ready to file the dissertation. Tulane's general guidelines permit a maximum of seven years from your initial matriculation to file the Ph.D.\n",

      "Elective courses (18 credits): The remaining 18 credits should be graduate level physics or materials electives, or graduate level courses in a related field with approval of the research supervisor and graduate program advisor. One of the electives must be a computational course (PHYS 6170 Computational Physics and Engineering, MPEN 6290 Computational Materials Science and Engineering, or a computational course in another department approved by the graduate program advisor).

If a student receives one B- grade, the student is immediately considered for probation by the Associate Dean for Graduate Studies in consultation with the appropriate department/program. If a student receives two grades of B-, or one grade less than B-, during his/her tenure in the School of Science and Engineering, the student is placed on probation and considered for dismissal by the Associate Dean in consultation with the appropriate department/program.”\n",
      "A student who does not maintain the minimum 3.0 GPA in graduate course work will be subject to disenrollment. To continue in the program, MPE students must have a minimum 3.2 GPA from a minimum 8 graduate courses by the end of the 4th semester, not including research courses.\n",
      "Oral Qualifying Exam:\n",
      "The Ph.D. oral qualifying exam is presented by the student to a committee of three materials faculty at Tulane, chosen in consultation with the research supervisor and the graduate program advisor. A student must choose three research articles in agreement with committee members, one approved by each committee member, with each representative of a different topic in MPE not including the student’s specific research area. The student must present a maximum 10 minute overview of the paper followed by about 20 minutes of questions on that topic. The exam duration is 1.5 to 2 hours total. The student must attempt the oral qualifying exam by the end of the 4th semester. A second attempt is allowed and must be completed by the end of the fifth week of the fifth semester (two total attempts allowed). The committee votes pass/fail on each paper topic, with unanimous agreement required to pass that topic. A student must pass all three topics. If one or more is failed, the student is allowed one additional chance to pass the failed topics, but with a different research article for each (again agreed between the student and committee). Passed topics do not need to be repeated in the 2nd attempt. Any student who has not passed the qualifying exam by the end of the fifth semester of graduate study will be disenrolled from the program.\n",

      "Faculty Dissertation Committee:\n",
      "Prior to the prospectus defense, the student and research supervisor form the faculty dissertation committee, which consists of the research supervisor (chair) and at least two other faculty members. One member may be from another Tulane department or other appropriate institution. The faculty dissertation committee (henceforth the committee) examines the student at the prospectus defense and oral dissertation defense, and approves the final written dissertation.\n",
      "Prospectus Defense:\n",
      "The prospectus defense demonstrates to the committee that the student has acquired sufficient knowledge in the specific research area and can effectively express that knowledge orally and in writing. A student must pass the oral qualifying exam before undertaking the prospectus defense. The prospectus defense consists of a written proposal and an oral defense:\n",
      "The written research proposal (10-15 pages) contains an introduction, proposed research and justification, methods, preliminary results, and discussion. It must be reviewed and approved by the committee before the end of the sixth semester of graduate study.\n",
      "The oral defense is a two-hour oral examination, including a research presentation (about 45 minutes) prepared by the student, given by the committee. The examination includes specific questions about the student's research as well as broadly focused questions on the general area of research. The oral defense must be attempted following approval of the written proposal, no later than the sixth semester of graduate study. If failed, the student is normally given a second attempt in the following semester. After two failures the student will be disenrolled from the program.\n",
      "Students who are sufficiently prepared are strongly encouraged to take the prospectus defense before the end of the 4th semester of graduate study.\n",
      "It is expected that, after completion of the oral prospectus defense, the Ph.D. candidate will obtain a Research Assistantship (RA) in the same research group. In order to encourage this, the faculty have adopted a policy for allocating graduate students on TA's to research groups.\n",
      "Annual Report:\n",
      "In April of each year, every Ph.D. student will submit a brief annual progress report (1-2 pages) to the research supervisor (and committee, when formed) summarizing research progress and accomplishments over the previous year, and future plans and milestones. This requirement is waived in the years when the prospectus and thesis defenses are completed.\n",

      "While students develop MD/MPH competencies specific to both their medical and public health curricula (see below for links to specific competencies), the competency that bridges the public health curriculum with the medical school curriculum is that MD/MPH students graduate from the MD/MPH program with the ability to use educational experiences in the School of Medicine to apply population-based and public health findings and principles in assessing individuals and groups at risk of disease and injury and to translate these findings and principles into recommendations and actions for improved health in clinical practice settings.\n",
      "In addition to completing their School of Medicine curriculum, MD/MPH combined degree students must also complete the following requirements:\n",
      "Students should verify all requirements with their SPHTM department and should make contact with their advisors each semester to verify their progress toward their degrees.\n",
      "MD/MPH competencies for each department mirror that department's general competencies, which are available at the following links:\n",
      "MD Requirements\n",
      "Courses in the School of Medicine that provide public health content and that MD/MPH combined degree students are required to take include the following:\n",
      "Any changes in the School of Medicine curriculum that reduce the public health content courses may require that MD/MPH combined degree students complete additional credit hours in the School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine to meet degree requirements.\n",
      "Generally, MD students are able to complete only a single combined degree during their customary time at SOM.  Multiple combined degrees are generally not possible or advisable.\n",
      "Tulane's MD/MPH program offers the following two options for students who have (1) earned a baccalaureate degree, and (2) already been admitted to Tulane University School of Medicine (SOM) and who wish to complete the requirements for both the medical degree and public health degree:\n",
      "Applicants to the 4-year program must have earned a 28 or higher on the MCAT and/or a 504 or higher on the MCAT2015.\n",
      "Requirements for the MD/MPH combined degree should be completed within 4 years: students must graduate with both degrees concurrently.\n",
      "Students are strongly encouraged to begin the combined degree program the summer before their SOM curriculum begins. Students may begin the four-year program as late as the spring of their T1 year. If you have been admitted to SOM, you can apply for the four-year program.  Please emailAdam Maesefor an application form.\n",
      "Students who will require more than 4 years to complete the requirements for the medical and the public health degrees are also eligible for the MD/MPH combined degree program. Students choose this option for a variety of reasons, including a desire to focus exclusively on public health for a year, career exploration, Couples Match timing, and a host of other personal reasons.\n",
      "In the five-year option, students must graduate with both degrees concurrently. The most common path for these students is to take a leave of absence from SOM after either the T2 or T3 year of medical school.\n",
      "Students who choose this option have been admitted to SOM and are generally in their T2 or T3 years. Students may also begin the program by pursuing the four-year option and then opt to take a year off from SOM to complete the MD/MPH combined degree in five years. The requirements for both options are the same; however, the application process differs.\n",
      "T4 students are not eligible to begin their public health studies as part of the five-year program in the MD/MPH combined degree program. However, T4 SOM students who wish to pursue a public health degree are encouraged to pursue their public health degree as a non-combined-degree student by applying directly to the School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine and completing the public health curriculum for non-combined-degree students.\n",
      "A student may not receive the MD degree and then continue working on MPH requirements as part of the MD/MPH combined degree program. A student may graduate with the MD degree and may continue working towards their public health degree, but must meet the full MPH, MSPH, or MPH&TM requirements for non-combined-degree students. MD/MPH students can discuss the non-combined-degree public health requirements with their public health advisors if they wish to delay completing their MPH requirements until after they earn their MD degrees.\n",

      "This33-credit-hour program leading to a Master of Science in Bioethics and Medical Humanitiesis completed while earning the MD, with all coursework normally completed in the first two years of the MD program. The MS isgrantedat the same time as the MDand addsno additional timeto the four years of medical school.MS coursework is done onWednesday and Fridayafternoons — reserved specifically in Years 1 and 2 for all of the School of Medicine's dual degree program students and for medical student electives — and through elective coursework offered in the summers before and after Year 1.\n",
      "Students in professional schools may also complete the program in its one-year format in a gap year, allowing them to graduate with the MD and MS in 5 total years.\n",
      "The core courses provide essential grounding in the foundations of bioethics and medical humanities, current controversies in health care ethics, and the social and ethical contexts of health care decision-making; participation in hospital rounds emphasizes the practical realities of clinical ethics, and a capstone seminar integrates program courses with one another and with students’ experience in the health care professions. The program also offers elective courses and with permission other relevant courses from other schools and departments at Tulane University may be taken as electives.Students can focus on either bioethics or medical humanities, and upon graduation will be well-suitedforrolesonclinical ethics committees and consultation, IRBs,and teaching ethics and medical humanities in schools of medicine and elsewhere.\n",

Students graduating after 2021 are advised that the Curriculum Committee may further reduce the maximum number of online electives that T4s may complete.\n",
      "In the first two semesters, all students take the identical core curriculum, described below. In conjunction with the course work in the first year, students rotate in 6-week blocks through three of the Program’s participating research laboratories of the student’s choice. This allows students to become more familiar with BMS research and faculty. Students should choose a Dissertation Advisor by the end of the second semester but must choose a Dissertation Advisor by the end of the third semester. Students may choose to further specify their study by choosing an Area of Research Emphasis (a Departmental Track in Anatomy, Biochemistry, Medical Genetics and Genomics, Microbiology and Immunology, Pathology, Pharmacology or Physiology).

Now, the entire university community, including the schools of Architecture, Business, Law, Liberal Arts, Medicine, Public Health and Tropical Medicine, Science and Engineering and Social Work – is committed to public service.\n",
      "Public service is of particular importance to those entering our one year masters program, because providing a track record of significant public or community service has become a prerequisite for admission to most US medical schools. Students are expected to move beyond the scope of academics and work in a community to improve the health of a population. This is \"what medicine is all about\".\n",
      "As a result, a core requirement of our Masters program in Pharmacology is that students provide public or community service averaging at least 1 hour per week, or 12 hours per semester. During the 2017-18 academic year, students in our pharmacology Master's program performed over 2167 hours of public service in the New Orleans area (with an average of 68 hours per student for the academic year).\n",
      "Tulane has a Center for Public Service that helps connect students with numerous community partners & outreach programs that are active in the New Orleans area. As a part of the pharmacology curriculum, students are required to document their service activities in short essays, posted photos or video clips, and reflect upon the learning garnered from such activities in an online blog or wiki page. In addition, students are also expected to reflect on what they have learned from their academic and classroom activities.\n",
      "Tulane is setting the standard for public service for the next generation of universities. When you receive a Tulane education, you will get a little something extra from community service activities that most other institutions don't offer. Our students get a unique educational experience that can be found Only in New Orleans. Only at Tulane.\n",

It covers the typical U.S. undergraduate physics curriculum with an emphasis on classical electrodynamics and quantum mechanics. The qualifying exam must be attempted no later than the fourth semester of graduate study. Students who are sufficiently prepared may take it during the first year with approval of the research supervisor. The passing score is 60%. Students who fail the qualifying exam must retake it until passed. Students may attempt the qualifying exam up to three times. Any student who has not passed the qualifying exam by the end of the fifth semester of graduate study will be disenrolled from the program.\n",

One member may be from another Tulane department or other appropriate institution. The faculty dissertation committee (henceforth the committee) examines the student at the prospectus defense and oral dissertation defense, and approves the final written dissertation.\n",
      "The prospectus defense demonstrates to the committee that the student has acquired sufficient knowledge in the specific research area and can effectively express that knowledge orally and in writing. A student must pass the written qualifying exam before undertaking the prospectus defense. The prospectus defense consists of a written proposal and an oral defense:\n",
      "The written research proposal (10-15 pages) contains an introduction, proposed research and justification, methods, preliminary results, and discussion. It must be reviewed and approved by the committee before the end of the sixth semester of graduate study.\n",
      "The oral defense is a two-hour oral examination, including a research presentation (about 45 minutes) prepared by the student, given by the committee. The examination includes specific questions about the student's research as well as broadly focused questions on the general area of research. The oral defense must be attempted following approval of the written proposal, no later than the sixth semester of graduate study. If failed, the student is normally given a second attempt in the following semester. After two failures the student will be disenrolled from the program (exceptions due to extenuating circumstances may be granted by vote of the faculty).\n",
      "Students who are sufficiently prepared are strongly encouraged to take the prospectus defense before the end of the 4th semester of graduate study.\n",
      "It is expected that, after completion of the oral prospectus defense, the Ph.D. candidate will obtain a Research Assistantship (RA) in the same research group. In order to encourage this, the faculty have adopted a policy for allocating graduate students on TA's to research groups.\n",
      "In April of each year, every Ph.D. student will submit a brief annual progress report (1-2 pages) to the research supervisor (and committee, when formed) summarizing research progress and accomplishments over the previous year, and future plans and milestones. This requirement is waived in the years when the prospectus and thesis defenses are completed.\n",
      "The final requirement for the Ph.D. degree is a written dissertation based on original research, approved by the committee, and its defense in an oral exam by the committee.\n",
      "The master's degree is not a requirement for the Ph.D. in physics. Admission with financial aid is only for doctoral students. However a graduate student may receive an M.S. in Physics based on 30 hours of approved graduate credit, or (if the research supervisor agrees to offer this option) an M.S. in Physics based on 24 hours of approved graduate credit plus a thesis deemed acceptable by the research supervisor. Research course credit does not count toward the M.S. in Physics degree.\n",

Whereas a Ph.D. in economics is a research degree, the M.A. in Policy Economics provides a curriculum of applied analysis and quantitative techniques better suited for the practitioner of economics.\n",
      "This program provides students with a deep and broad exposure to the analytical methods of modern economics that can be applied to policy settings, without requiring the advanced mathematics training that is only essential to academic researchers. The program builds on the strengths of the bachelor's degrees in Economics at Tulane by increasing the required number of economics courses and expanding their rigor and depth. In courses offered jointly with the undergraduates, M.A. students are held to higher academic standards and are generally assigned supplementary research work. Successful students can expect to complete at least seven applied projects in the course of earning the M.A. degree.\n",
      "Internal applicants (4 + 1) must must satisfy all remaining bachelor's degree requirements in their senior year in the undergraduate program. In satisfying these requirements, they may take at most 4 6000-level courses in economics (12 credit hours) that will also count towards the degree of M.A. in Policy Economics. The remaining 24 credit hours must be taken after graduation from their undergraduate program.\n",

Students with an MA in design or production may, at the discretion of the faculty, complete their degree sooner. Normally, 48 hours of course work are required for completion of the degree. In addition, twelve hours are earned with the internship assignment and a thesis production.\n",
      "It is the philosophy of the design faculty that the design process is best taught through the realization of designs in actual production situations. Each year, the Department of Theatre and Dance provides a number of opportunities for such realized design projects. The department produces three to four mainstage productions and one dance concert each year directed by faculty or guest directors. Students in design and technical direction are assigned to these projects as their skills develop. The Third Year Thesis Project becomes the culmination of a number of realized projects. The selection of this production is intended to provide a showcase of each student's talents and skill. Each student's work is reviewed by the faculty on a semester-to-semester basis.\n",
      "Admission to the MFA Design program is highly selective and only a small number of candidates are selected every other year. This ensures each student considerable production experience as well as continual one-on-one contact with Theatre Design faculty. Prospective applicants are referred to the Graduate Program in the School of Liberal Arts for application materials and a catalog outlining further requirements and deadlines.\n",
      "Please note that while the university states a February 1 application deadline, the department extends its deadline past that date as we traditionally recruit at USITT in March. Admission to the program is based primarily on consideration of the candidate's academic ability as evidenced by his/her undergraduate GPA, previous theatre experience, and portfolio. The GRE is no longer required.\n",

If a secondary area of specialization is also elected, six units in that area, from the elective list, are required.\n",
      "Whenever possible, the design faculty utilizes class time as an opportunity to supervise closely the work of a student who is holding a design assignment in a given semester. For instance, if a student is enrolled in Costume Design and is also designing costumes for a production in the same semester, the design assignment will be substituted for one or more design projects.\n",
      "At the end of each semester, design students are required to attend the design gallery and an individual MFA review with the faculty. In the gallery, the student presents a record of his or her most representative work in the program and should be prepared to answer questions regarding that work. These reviews provide the all of faculty with the chance to see the work of individual students and exchange ideas and commentary on the student's progress. During their reviews, in additon to reviewing their work, students have an opportunity to voice their needs for further development within the program.\n",

If, however, a student's work (or attitude) is evaluated as undesirable or sub-standard, the student may be placed on probationary status the following semester. If the quality of the student's work has not improved by the end of the probationary semester, the student will be asked to leave the program. In some cases where either a student's work, attitude, or grades are deemed so unsatisfactory that their continuation in the program would be of no benefit to either them or the department, dismissal may be considered, in consultation with the Dean of the School of Liberal Arts. The student will be notified of his or her status in written form following their review each semester.\n",

This is required of a student regardless of acceptance or non-acceptance of a stipend. Any student offered an assistantship will be granted a full tuition waiver.  Currently, all of our graduate students receive a stipend and a full tuition waiver.\n",

      "Accounting, MACCT Overview Requirements The Master of Accounting (MACCT) degree, a STEM-designated program, prepares college graduates for successful careers in public accounting firms and major corporations. Through a comprehensive, industry-endorsed curriculum which requires 30 credit hours, students develop analytical skills and acquire the professional expertise to take on the challenges of a professional accounting career. The MACCT program offers two-semester and three-semester options, the latter of which allows time for students who begin their studies in the fall to complete a summer internship. Freeman also offers a five-year joint Bachelor of Science in Management/Master of Accounting (BSM/MACCT) program. This course of study is designed to give students the knowledge, skills and preparation to immediately enter the accounting profession following graduation. In just five years, students graduate with two degrees, eligibility to sit for the CPA exam in the jurisdictions of their choice, and the confidence and expertise to become an accounting professional. Curriculum Prerequisites To be admitted to the MACCT program, a student must have an appropriate undergraduate background in accounting or business and have satisfactorily completed the following prerequisite courses: Financial Accounting Principles [ ACCN 2010 Financial Accounting (3 c.h.) or equivalent] - Concepts, techniques, and conventions for measuring and communicating the results of operations and the financial position of a business enterprise are introduced. Emphasis is placed on the development and use of publicly-reported financial information. Managerial/Cost Accounting Principles [ ACCN 3010 Managerial Accounting (3 c.h.) or equivalent] - The role of accounting information in management decision-making for profit-seeking organizations is emphasized. The importance of information to decision-relevance is developed through study of traditional cost accounting, managerial economics, operations research, and the behavioral sciences. Intermediate Accounting I and II [ ACCN 3100 Intermediate Accounting I (3 c.h.) and ACCN 4110 Intermediate Accounting II (3 c.h.) or equivalent] - These conceptually-oriented courses introduce intensive examination of financial reporting issues, financial statement categories, and the institutional environment of financial accounting. Students may complete the prerequisite courses in their undergraduate programs or prior to MACCT matriculation at a school accredited by The Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB). Degree Requirements BSM/MACCT Students In addition to their BSM degree requirements, dual-degree students must complete the following coursework or equivalent: Course List Course ID Title Credits ACCN 7100 Ethics in Accounting and Finance 3 ACCN 7110 Auditing 3 ACCN 7120 Advanced Financial Accounting 3 ACCN 7140 Advanced Managerial Accounting 3 LGST 7210 Business Law 3 TAXN 7100 Principles of Entity Taxation 3 Plus 3 credit hours of ACCN/TAXN electives 3 Plus 9 credit hours of other approved electives 9 Total Credit Hours 30 MACCT Students Students entering the MACCT program must complete the following 18 credit hours of required courses, plus a non-credit career development and management course.

Note: Students are not required to meet the educational requirements to sit for the Certified Public Accountant (CPA) exam in any state or territory. However, they may elect to become eligible if they wish. In this case, they would work closely with their MACCT faculty adviser to develop an appropriate program plan. The final determination of whether a CPA exam applicant meets the educational qualifications necessary to sit for the exam in any given U.S. state or territory resides solely with the Board of Accountancy in that state or territory. All State Boards of Accountancy require evaluation and approval of a candidate’s academic credentials prior to sitting for the exam. See the National Association of State Boards of Accountancy (NASBA) website at https://nasba.org/ for more details including links to the state/territory jurisdictions as well as services that provide academic evaluations of coursework and credentials. Students who do not have an undergraduate business degree may need to take additional courses to qualify to sit for the CPA exam. Specializations While all MACCT students can earn an accounting major on their graduate transcripts, it is possible for students to pursue a tax major or a variety of specializations. Requirements for the tax major and all specializations within the MACCT program follow. Students may not count the same course for multiple specializations. However, if a course is required for two specializations, students may substitute the required course with another approved course for the second specialization.

      "Major: Aging Studies, PhD - Home Content\n",
      "Aging Studies, PhD Overview Requirements Mission Statement Our program focuses on the processes of aging at the individual and societal level. It examines how people change over the adult life course, the interrelationships between older people and social institutions, and the societal impact of the changing age-composition of the population. We emphasize the dynamic interplay between the aging of individuals and their changing biomedical, social, and physical environments and multi-level interactions among psychological, physiological, genetic, social, and cultural domains. Our goal is integration and synthesis within and across these domains. Our faculty’s teaching and research emphasizes molecular, cellular, animal and human studies and takes place in a wide range of disciplinary and departmental settings across all of the schools at the university. Our students and faculty provide the foundation for this enterprise, working to create a new generation of leaders in this interdisciplinary field who will assume key positions in academia and in the public and private sectors. The program facilitates both basic and translational research allowing program participants to design and develop working models or implement a process that will initiate viable products or services for older adults in the expanding global community. History The Interdisciplinary Ph.D. Program in Aging Studies was established in 2009, in response to a call by the Provost’s Office for interdisciplinary Ph.D. programs issued in 2008. The Program conforms to applicable University policies and regulations. The first class of students matriculated in the fall of 2010. Our Program is university-wide, encompassing all the Schools at Tulane University, and it is located in the School of Medicine. On successful completion of all program requirements, the student is awarded the “Doctor of Philosophy in Aging Studies.” The University funds student stipends and provides tuition waivers. Our Research Culture A PhD degree can only be earned by performing original and significant research that is suitable for publication in a peer-reviewed journal, in addition to any other program requirements. It cannot be earned by fulfillment of course requirements or residence for any specific period of time. We take courses to prepare us to begin to assimilate the latest findings, often prior to publication, in a variety of disciplines. Research seminars provide this new information, and they are not designed to be general in nature. An aspiring scholar must show sufficient curiosity to participate. Research seminars do not distract from research; they enhance it, which becomes only evident to a more advanced scholar. Research is a full-time activity (24/7). It involves sustained, hard work, great dedication, creativity, intellect, knowledge, and luck. One learns how to perform research by doing it under the guidance of a master, to whom the student serves as an apprentice. The PhD degree is bestowed only when the faculty determine that a student deserves the high honor of joining the fellowship of scholars, a life-long appointment that carries with it great responsibility to oneself, to the fellowship, to the university, and to society. The Interdisciplinary Ph.D. Program in Aging Studies is comprised of graduate students and faculty from eight schools at Tulane University and includes the Schools of Science and Engineering, Medicine, Public Health and Tropical Medicine, Liberal Arts, Social Work, Business, Law, and Architecture. The curriculum is designed to prepare students for successful careers in existing and emerging fields related to aging. Core courses include a two-semester Introductory Seminar on Aging, Topics in Aging Research, a biomedical course, a psychosocial course, and two semesters of research methods. Students also take specialized elective courses, while performing research, beginning in the first year of the Program. All course work is completed in two years, allowing the students to concentrate full time on research from their third year on. Each student is guided closely by an academic advisor and co-advisor to facilitate integration across disciplinary domains, and by a dissertation committee. To obtain the Ph.D., each student passes a written preliminary examination following completion of course work at which time the student advances to candidacy for the Ph.D. degree. Students prepare a dissertation research proposal, under guidance of the dissertation committee, then submit and defend orally a dissertation based on their own original research contribution to the field. Distribution Requirements Students will complete the general sequence of studies under the guidance of the program advisor and program committee recommendations. 24 graduate credits in aging-associated core and elective courses 6 graduate credits in research methods/statistics 6 credits in the Introductory Seminar (Proseminar) during the first year of study 6 credits in the program seminar course during the first through third years or until advancement to Candidacy 3 to 6 credits of internship At least two semesters of dissertation research Credits in Aging Seminar are required through Year Three and thereafter until advancement to Candidacy and registration for Dissertation Research Typical Schedule during Years One to Three Plan of Study Grid Year 1 Fall Credit Hours Proseminar in Aging 3 Psychosocial Core Course 3 Biomedical Core Course 3 Research Methods/Statistics 3 Research Topics in Aging 1 Aging Seminar 1 Credit Hours 14 Spring Proseminar in Aging 3 Biomedical Domain Elective 3 Psychosocial Domain Elective 3 Research Methods/Statistics 3 Research Topics in Aging 1 Aging Seminar 1 Credit Hours 14 Year 2 Fall Biomedical Domain Elective 3 Psychosocial Domain Elective 3 Independent Study/Research 1-6 Aging Seminar 1 Advanced Statistics (optional) Credit Hours 8-13 Spring Biomedical or Psychosocial Domain Electives 6 Independent Study/Research 1-6 Aging Seminar 1 Advanced Statistics (optional) Credit Hours 8-13 Year 3 Fall Independent Study/Research 1-6 Internship 3-6 Aging Seminar 1 Credit Hours 5-13 Spring Dissertation Research Aging Seminar 1 Credit Hours 1 Total Credit Hours 50-68 In addition, students are required to take an approved course in Responsible Conduct of Research (RCR). Several such courses are offered at Tulane. (See Vice President for Research website.) The course offered through the Office of Research consists of about six lectures and offers a certificate of completion. A similar course is offered for credit by the Master’s in Clinical Research Program at the School of Medicine. There is also an online CITI course (See Vice President for Research website.) Students must complete one of these courses before the end of the second year. Documentation of completion must be provided to the program office. Ideally, this course is taken in the fall semester of the second year. All students are expected to regularly attend the activities included in the Seminar (AGST 7100), even though credit is not awarded after the third year or after advancement to Candidacy, whichever is later. This includes presentations of their work-in-progress. The Program Office schedules students for their work-in-progress seminars throughout the year, and each student must present at least once each year to remain in good standing in the program. These presentations and presence of all students at the work-in-progress seminars is mandatory. Graduate work is a full-time effort. The number of credit hours does not indicate the amount of time that the student devotes to this effort. Students are required to spend all of their time outside the classroom to study/research.\n",

      "Anthropology Minor Overview Requirements Anthropology - the study of humanity in its broadest sense - is, according to Eric Wolf  “the most humanistic of the sciences and the most scientific of the humanities.” At Tulane, anthropology is divided into four subdisciplines: anthropological archaeology, biological anthropology, linguistic anthropology, and sociocultural anthropology. These subdisciplines or fields are interconnected.  The minor is designed to be flexible in terms of each student’s interests, but students must achieve a breadth of courses across at least two of the subdisciplines. Per Newcomb-Tulane College rules, no more than one course can count for both this minor and another major. The anthropology minor requires five 3- to 4-credit hour ANTH classes, of which: at least 4 are at the 2000-level or above at least two anthropological subdisciplines are represented at the 2000+ level A minor in anthropology consists of at least five 3- to 4-credit hour ANTH classes. The only curricular requirement is that of these five classes, only one can be at the 1000-level, and at least one 2000-level (or higher) class must come from a second anthropological subdiscipline (i.e., not all of a student’s upper level classes can be drawn from a single anthropological subdiscipline). The anthropological subdisciplines at Tulane are anthropological archaeology, biological anthropology, sociocultural anthropology, and linguistic anthropology.\n",

      "Anthropology, BA Overview Requirements Anthropology - the study of humanity in its broadest sense - is, according to the late cultural anthropologist Eric Wolf,  “the most humanistic of the sciences and the most scientific of the humanities.” At Tulane, anthropology is divided into four subdisciplines: anthropological archaeology, biological anthropology, anthropological linguistics, and socio-cultural or cultural anthropology. These subdisciplines or fields are interconnected. Anthropologists at Tulane often straddle the boundaries of the subdisciplines, and they collaborate with scholars from other departments and schools of the University. Anthropology is perhaps the world’s oldest transdisciplinary field of study. At Tulane, anthropologists study topics as seemingly disparate as two million year-old fossil hominins in Africa, capuchin monkeys in Costa Rica, the impact of Islam in West Africa, Mayan hieroglyphic texts, political movements in Mexico, indigenous use of the environment in the Amazon, variations in spoken New Orleans English - and much more! The roots of Tulane’s Department of Anthropology date from 1924, when the Department of Middle American Research (now the Middle American Research Institute [MARI]) was founded on the Uptown Campus. Anthropology courses were first offered at Tulane during the 1938-1939 academic year, and by 1947, anthropologists were employed in a Department of Sociology and Anthropology. A separate four-field Department of Anthropology was established in 1968. In 2010, the Department and MARI moved into newly-renovated space in Dinwiddie Hall. The Department of Anthropology has since 1990 more than doubled in size and diversity of the faculty, and course offerings today reflect that growth. Tulane’s Department of Anthropology has long been known for its focus in the areas of archaeology, cultural anthropology, and linguistics of Mesoamerica (the region from Central Mexico to El Salvador), and the department retains that area of emphasis. In addition, today the geographical teaching and research interests of our faculty include, in addition to Mesoamerica, North America (especially the southeastern United States and the Gulf South); South America (especially the Andes and the Amazon); lower Central America and the Caribbean;  West Africa; the South Asian subcontinent; Southeast Asia; and Europe. At least one course above the 1000 level in each of the four major subdivisions of anthropology: anthropological archaeology, biological anthropology, linguistic anthropology, and socio-cultural anthropology. Students may take no more than two 1000-level courses (six credit hours) as electives to be counted towards the 30 credit hours required for degrees in anthropology. Five or six elective courses in anthropology. Newcomb-Tulane College requires all undergraduates to take a writing practicum or a writing-intensive course to fulfill its undergraduate writing requirement. Some anthropology courses may have writing-intensive sections, but the additional credit hours earned through writing-intensive courses are not counted towards the 30 hours necessary for degrees in anthropology.

Upon consultation with anthropology faculty advisors, students may count up to six credits (two courses) as electives towards the anthropology major from approved courses in other departments. The subject matter of anthropology is such that most of the curriculum is not an explicitly ordered sequence. Few anthropology courses at Tulane have specific prerequisites (exceptions, mostly linguistic courses, are noted in the catalog), and anthropology majors are expected to choose their courses from among all those with numbers less than 7000. The 6000-level courses are specifically designed for undergraduate as well as graduate students, and all junior and senior majors should choose freely from among these offerings. Anthropology majors are eligible to apply for the 4+1 program in anthropology, based on consultation with advisors and other mentors. Students in the 4+1 program can earn B.A. or B.S. degrees in anthropology within four years, and M.A. degrees in anthropology based on an additional year of graduate coursework in anthropology taken during their fourth and fifth years. Requirements for this program are outlined on the departmental web site and in the anthropology majors handbook. The anthropology department administers the Kenneth J. Opat Fund in Anthropology, reserved for the support of undergraduate research in anthropology. Students majoring in anthropology are encouraged to seek further information from their anthropology advisors about the use of this research fund.\n",

      "Major: Architecture, B.Arch - Home Content\n",
      "Architecture, B.Arch Overview Requirements The five-year Bachelor of Architecture (B.Arch) program is structured with required courses and electives that provide thorough professional preparation and opportunities for study in the liberal arts and advanced study in architecture. This degree is accredited by the National Architectural Accrediting Board (NAAB). First Year First-year courses include required study in design, visual and digital media, architectural history and theory, technological systems, writing, and other electives in cultural knowledge and scientific inquiry. The emphasis in first-year design focuses on developing a fundamental understanding of formal, spatial and material principles in architecture, while obtaining a strong skill base in freehand drawing, descriptive geometry, material techniques, and visual and digital media. First-year electives allow students to supplement their background in physics or calculus, begin or advance foreign language study, broaden their skills in the arts, or choose any other subject area from among dozens offered by the university’s undergraduate divisions. In their first semester, students may also participate in one of the many TIDES (Tulane InterDisciplinary Experience) courses offered by the university to engage other students and faculty in an intimate, interactive environment. Second and Third Years Second and third-year courses cover the majority of the program requirements. Intensive studio work in architectural design is complemented by study in architectural history and theory, structures, technological systems, digital media and urban studies. In second-year, students are fully immersed in digital design techniques while learning to incorporate knowledge from historic, environmental, social, programmatic and technological studies into the design studio. This is followed by third-year, where, in the second semester, coordinated coursework allows students a truly synthetic experience in the integrated design of a complex architectural project. Fourth Year The fourth-year curriculum involves advanced architectural design in elective studio courses as well as graduate level seminars in architectural theory, technology, professional concerns, urban studies, and digital media. In the fourth year of study, emphasis is placed on the relationship of architecture to the urban environment, both locally and globally. Students may spend one semester studying in one of the school's many programs ranging from urban design, to housing, to design/build. In the fourth-year, students will also have the opportunity for international study through various programs and research studios. Upper level study is intended to be diverse and includes many electives intended to provide significant opportunities for study within architecture as well as in the liberal arts and sciences. Fifth Year In the fifth year of study, students will develop an advanced thesis through research, analysis and design in one of four topical areas. In the fifth year of study, students will develop an advanced thesis through research, analysis and design in one of four curricular streams.

      "Art History, MA Overview Requirements Since 1960, the MA program in the history of art at Tulane has prepared outstanding students for careers in research, teaching, and museum work. About a third of our graduates have continued toward their doctoral degrees either at Tulane or elsewhere. The program welcomes students who have majored in fields other than art history. The MA stipend is about $18,500 a year. Course List Course ID Title Credits Eight 6000 or 7000 level courses 24 Three of which should be with the student's faculty advisor or in the student's thesis area ARHS 6910 Independent Study 3 ARHS 9980 Master's Research 6 Curriculum: The MA requires 30 credit hours (8 courses), including 24 credits (8 courses) at the 6000 and 7000 levels, plus 6 credits of Masters Research and a thesis. Distribution requirements call for art history MA students to take at least one class in each of the following three areas: 1) art of Ancient and Medieval Europe and Asia, the Pre-Columbian Americas; 2) art of Renaissance, Baroque, and 18th-c. Europe, Early Modern Asia, the Colonial Americas; 3) modern art of Europe, Asia, and the Americas, especially the U.S., Caribbean, Latin America, and the African diaspora. Students are also expected to take three classes with the regular faculty teaching in the area that most closely relates to their own research, and who will most likely be on their thesis committee. The 7000-level courses are for graduate students only and are sometimes taught in tandem with 3000-level courses for undergraduates. The 6000-level courses are taken by juniors and seniors as well as graduate students. Both include seminars on special topics. With the permission of their graduate advisor, students may take two courses outside the art history program. Language Requirement: Reading proficiency in at least one foreign language relevant to the student's work is required. French, German, Italian, Latin, and Spanish are especially useful for research in art history. The requirement is satisfied by passing a reading exam. Because reading knowledge of foreign languages is necessary for research in most art-historical fields, students are urged to take their language exam early. Thesis: An important step in the MA program is the writing of a thesis and its subsequent oral defense. The thesis may be the outgrowth of a seminar paper, or it may focus on a special interest of the student insofar as it falls within the area of competency of the faculty. Students work with their graduate advisors in selecting the appropriate topic, establishing the three-member thesis committee, and preparing the thesis prospectus by the end of the first year. One member of the thesis committee may be from another department or school in the university. While moderate in length and considerably more limited in scope than a doctoral dissertation, the MA thesis should demonstrate the student's ability to do research of publishable quality. The defense usually takes place a month before the end of the last semester.\n",

      "Biochemistry and Applied Bioinformatics, MS Overview Requirements This is a two-year thesis-requiring program for study leading to a Master of Science degree in Biochemistry and Applied Bioinformatics. In year one, students will acquire an academic foundation in biochemistry and bioinformatics and then, in year two, specialize in a sub-field as befits their research or employment interests. The program is designed to improve the academic credentials and scientific research experience of graduates. Our distinctive program emphasizes student development in six areas (coursework, laboratory skills, bioinformatic analysis, independent thought, presentation skills, and personal growth), allows students to broaden and strengthen their academic foundation, and equips students with basic and advanced lab and bioinformatics skills for a career in academic or industrial research. Students will take Graduate Biochemistry, Cell Biology, Biostatistics, and Bioinformatics courses, with a strong emphasis on research application of biochemical, molecular and bioinformatic knowledge.  Bioinformatics training focuses on skills in the application of diverse tools and databases addressing genomics, gene expression, proteomics, metabolism, and protein structure, function, and drug binding.  These courses are taken along with first-year PhD students at the Tulane School of Medicine.  All students will benefit from several other Biochemistry- or Molecular Biology-related courses, including a Biochemistry and Molecular Biology Seminar series, a Biochemistry Workshop, and a course on Academic Writing and Critique. All courses are taught within the Tulane School of Medicine by full time faculty. In year two, students will perform bench or bioinformatic research toward the master’s thesis and experience all aspects of basic research under supervision of a faculty advisor, from the development of an idea and scientific rationale, to experimental design and execution, data analysis, and possibly the drafting of a manuscript.  Examples of high-level bioinformatics analysis (tools/databases) include the construction of mutational signatures from genome-sequencing data (Blast, Clustal, GenBank, CBioPortal), tumor pathological staging on the basis of gene expression presented in t-SNE projections (10X Genomics), immunological epitope mapping by analysis of protein conformational stability (Protein Data Bank, Swiss-Model), and in-silico drug-screening for protein binding (Autodock). Students must take 30 credit hours of coursework by the end of the spring semester in year two, and they must complete and defend a master’s thesis by the end of the summer in year two.  Thesis research may commence at the beginning of year one, upon formation of the advisory committee.  The student is expected to devote full time to research after the spring semester of year one, and until the thesis defense in the summer of year two.

      "Biochemistry, MS Overview Requirements Biochemistry Masters 1-Year Program A two-semester graduate program designed to enrich and improve credentials of graduates to apply for admission to medical, dental or other healthcare-related profession programs. Program Overview This is a two-semester non-thesis program leading to a Master of Biomedical Science in Biochemistry degree. The program is primarily designed to enrich and improve academic credentials of graduates. Our distinctive program emphasizes student development in four areas (coursework, experiential learning, presentation skills, and personal growth), and allows students to broaden and strengthen their academic foundation for further intellectual development, such as gaining entrance into medical-, dental- or health profession-related schools. The core curriculum emphasizes clinical applications of biochemistry and molecular knowledge. Required courses include Human Medical Cellular Biochemistry and Human Medical Metabolic Biochemistry which are equivalent to Tulane’s first-year medical biochemistry course, Medical Biochemistry Grand Rounds Externship Seminar which provides students with a unique opportunity to experience Medicine Grand Rounds from the biochemical, molecular and clinical perspectives, and the Department Seminar series exposing students to novel research in the field of biochemistry. All students benefit from several other biochemistry- or molecular biology-related courses. Program electives range from more medically-related courses such as Chromosomal Instability and Cancer, Molecular Basis of Pediatric Disease, and Signal Transduction and Hormone Action to more research-related courses such as Biochemistry Research, Graduate-level Biochemistry, and Biomedical Statistics and Data Analysis. Additionally, the program has reciprocal relationships with certain courses in the Graduate Program in Biomedical Sciences, the Department of Microbiology and Immunology, the Department of Physiology, and the Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine. Students may elect to take Tulane first-year medical course equivalents in Graduate Medical Microbiology and Medical Immunology, Medical Physiology, Cancer Biology & Pathology, or Molecular & Cellular Pathology. All courses are taught within the Tulane School of Medicine by full time faculty. For the one year Program, students must take 30 credit hours of course work during the fall and spring semesters to complete the requirements for the degree. Additionally, students are required to take the NBME Shelf Exam in Biochemistry as a culminating experience.  Although not thesis based, this degree does involve several written assignments and oral presentations as part of the required course work. No research is required. Therefore, this is considered a \"non-thesis\" degree.\n",

      "Bioethics and Medical Humanities, MS Overview Requirements The Master of Science in Bioethics and Medical Humanities is a non-thesis, capstone-required program within Biomedical Sciences which can be completed in either a one- or a two-year course of study. As healthcare becomes increasingly complex with both technological advances as well as social decisions that must be faced, this master’s degree program will assist any learner who wishes to pursue healthcare ethics and humanities in their future. This is a 33-credit-hour program consisting of seven required core courses and four electives. This program accommodates Dual Degree MD-MS students (see below) and those students interested in pursuing the stand-alone MS degree. It is well-suited for both post-baccalaureate students progressing toward a terminal degree (e.g., an MD, JD, etc.) and mid-career professionals who wish to expand their potential in medical ethics and humanities. Students in professional schools wishing to take an MS in a gap year may complete the program in its one-year format. All courses in our program may be attended in-person or by live synchronous teleconferencing, allowing participation from virtually anywhere. Students pursue either the Bioethics Track or Medical Humanities Track to center their efforts, but the program is unique in providing the student both a bioethics and a medical humanities education through our interdisciplinary faculty brought together in the Program in Medical Ethics and Human Values. Core program faculty staffing the core courses are drawn from Philosophy, English, Medicine, Humanities and Clinical Ethics and boast a distinguished publication record in Bioethics and Medical Humanities. This MS degree can be also earned by incoming students at the Tulane School of Medicine as a Dual Degree (MD-MS) program, completed within the same 4 years of medical school.

      "Business Administration, Executive MBA Overview Requirements The Tulane Executive MBA (EMBA) is an accelerated alternate-weekend MBA program designed for experienced professionals to earn an MBA in 17 months.  The 48-credit-hour, lockstep curriculum offers the advanced business knowledge and management skills managers need to rise to higher challenges, improve career opportunities and drive corporate growth. All students earn a concentration in global strategy, and students may earn a second concentration in finance or management by choosing electives in those areas. Curriculum Pre-Program In the months immediately before the EMBA curriculum begins, prep courses in accounting and quantitative skills help to align student skills with the requirements of the early courses in the curriculum. The subsequent orientation and team building sessions will familiarize new students with policies and procedures, and introduce faculty, classmates, and study teams. Intensive Weeks The EMBA program begins in January with a week-long session, Intensive Week I. Students complete two courses, including exams, in this eight-day intensive. Here students are reintroduced to academic life and begin to practice time management, balancing work, home, and school responsibilities. A multicultural intensive week is held on the New Orleans campus in January of the second year. During this Intensive Week II, students form new global study teams, collaborating and sharing a classroom with their EMBA counterparts from partner universities in Asia, Europe and Latin America. Alternate Weekends After Intensive Week I, classes transition to an alternate weekend structure, where students attend classes on Fridays and Saturdays on alternate weekends. Each set of two courses, a module, is typically completed in seven weeks. Electives In the second half of the curriculum, elective courses are introduced. Students can earn finance or management concentrations by selecting the elective course tracks in those areas. International Seminar The international business seminar abroad brings a global depth to the program, giving students firsthand knowledge of global business and management practices and focusing on the strategic and operational issues of doing business abroad. Today's markets and their economic interdependence demand that managers understand global strategic imperatives. This essential management knowledge makes the international business experience a critical and required component of the EMBA curriculum. During the international seminar, students: Explore the economic, technological, and political environments that influence global business initiatives and discover global business opportunities specific to the host country. Develop a keen understanding of global business challenges and management strategies for meeting those challenges. Gain firsthand knowledge of global business culture and practice through face-to-face interaction with international business leaders. Learn the specific challenges these companies face and the strategies employed to meet these challenges. Work directly with local organizations to solve real business problems. For the seminar, we handle all academic and logistical planning, including airfare, ground transportation, logistics, accommodations, group meals and company visits. These seminar costs are included in the total program cost. The seminar destination is usually determined eight to twelve months in advance. In past years, seminars have been held in Beijing, Cape Town and Paris, each presenting students a distinct and culturally unique business environment.

      "Business Administration, Full-Time MBA Overview Requirements Three key pillars highlight the Freeman School's new full-time MBA curriculum: Data-driven real-world decision making – through a five-course data sequence, students learn to understand and apply insights from big data, to understand and appreciate the shortcomings of data, and to collect small focused data sets to precisely and rapidly answer critical questions. Cross-functional experiential learning – guided by interdisciplinary faculty, students work in cross-functional teams to solve high-impact community and business problems. Preparing managers for the business world of the future – students develop their skills as agile managers who can anticipate and manage crises and who understand the centrality of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) in business. Completed over four semesters, the full-time MBA program requires 61 credit hours. The curriculum encompasses knowledge core courses (20 credit hours), a data course sequence (10 credit hours), two intensive immersion courses (4 credit hours), a consulting practicum (3 credit hours), an impact capstone course (3 credit hours), and elective courses (21 credit hours). The knowledge core courses, taken throughout the first two semesters, are taught in seven-week sessions. They provide a foundation in all functional disciplines of business. The program provides an opportunity to understand the interrelationships among these disciplines and how they are integrated in the management of successful organizations. ESG issues are woven throughout the knowledge core. The data course sequence develops the ability to understand and apply insights from big data, to appreciate the shortcomings of data, and to collect small focused data sets to precisely and rapidly answer critical questions. The sequence includes statistics and analytics courses, an advanced data interpretation course, and two area-specific data core courses. The intensive immersion courses, focused on negotiations and successful leadership, take place just prior to the start of the spring semester of the first year and the start of the fall semester in the second year. Through the consulting practicum, a semester-long course in the spring of the first year, students work in teams on cross-disciplinary projects. Core course faculty from different business disciplines oversee and advise student teams. The impact capstone semester-long course, taken in the fall of the second year, draws on students' problem-solving skills from different business disciplines to help a local or regional company. Guided by core course faculty, these company projects focus on making a societal impact in the areas of sustainability, social inequities, or climate change. Finally, students complete elective courses in their second year through which they may earn concentrations or specializations in business analytics, finance, strategy and marketing, and/or sustainability. The elective set includes approximately 45 course options from the following fields of study: Accounting and Taxation (ACCN, TAXN) Business and Law (LGST, MCOM) Energy (ENRG) Finance and Economics (FINE, ECAN) Management (MGMT) Management Science (MGSC) Marketing (MKTG) In addition, two required career development courses help students identify appropriate career goals, conduct an effective job search and enhance their careers after graduation. The explicit consideration of career issues early in the program will be helpful in the selection of elective courses. A grade of pass in both non-credit career development courses is a requirement for graduation.

Unique Features of the Program The doctoral program has the following features: Niche in Freeman's Areas of Excellence: The program is focused on training students to publish research and to teach in the areas of corporate finance, investments and financial accounting. These are areas of research strength for Freeman faculty. Focus on Empirical Research: The finance, financial accounting and economics faculty have a research strength in empirical research. The classes students take are designed to build on this strength. Competitive Student Support: Freeman offers very competitive financial support which is designed to attract high-quality students and to enhance their success. Teaching Experience: PhD students will teach classes independently as part of the program. This provides the opportunity to show teaching effectiveness to potential employers and to facilitate an easier transition to a faculty job. Curriculum General Requirements Students earning the finance and financial accounting concentration of the Freeman School's Doctor of Philosophy in Business Administration degree are required to take a minimum of 48 credits. These credits include required coursework in the first two years of the program, a third-year paper, some elective choices and some independent research credits in subsequent years. Econometrics Comprehensive Exam In the summer after the first year, students will be required to take and pass the comprehensive exam in econometrics (to be administered and graded by the Department of Economics, with the passing grade determined by the tenure system Finance/Financial Accounting faculty). First-Year Paper In the summer after the first year, students will also be required to complete a replication of an empirical paper in finance or financial accounting. The paper assignment will be the principal requirement of a for-credit course and should be completed by the end of the summer term. Alternatively, students may work as a co-author with a tenure system faculty member, who along with a second tenure-track faculty member will certify that the student has met the requirements for the first-year paper in the joint work. Co-authoring arrangements will be based on voluntary agreements between students and faculty members, without any a priori guarantee or compulsion. Major Area Comprehensive Exam In the summer after the second year, students will be required to take and pass the comprehensive exam in finance. Third-Year Paper Starting in the summer after the second year (or earlier), students will be required to work on an independent research project in finance or financial accounting. This project should result in a paper and is to be completed under the supervision of an appropriate faculty committee approved by the program director. The student must complete and successfully present the paper to the finance and financial accounting faculty for advancement in the program. The final paper should be completed and presented by the end of the spring semester of the third year. The presentation will be considered an oral examination. Students successfully passing this examination will be admitted into candidacy. Dissertation Proposal and Defense After entering candidacy, students will be expected to actively pursue dissertation research. Finance Seminars/Workshops Students are required to attend finance/financial accounting workshops and seminars unless they have a class conflict or an emergency. They are also encouraged to attend seminars in the economics department. Scholarships, Assistantships and Teaching Requirements Students will be granted assistantships and scholarships for up to six years. The scholarship will be half of the financial assistance per year provided the student is making satisfactory progress. The assistantship will be an additional half of the financial assistance per year provided the student is making satisfactory progress and performing well in his or her assistantship duties. Students will be assigned to either a research assistantship or a teaching assistantship for each semester during the first 2 1/2 years in the program. They will rotate across the two types of assistantships, which will provide mentoring experiences for students on the teaching dimension and the research dimension. Each semester-long assistantship will entail 15 hours per week as a research or teaching assistant under the supervision of a faculty member. In the third year, students are expected to serve as a research or teaching assistant for one semester and to teach one course for the other semester. During the fourth and fifth year (and the sixth year if a student is still in the program), students will teach two courses per year for their assistantship. Note: Students must successfully complete one teaching assistantship and attend the CELT class for graduate teaching assistants before they teach a class independently.

      "Cell and Molecular Biology Major Overview Requirements The major in Cell and Molecular Biology is focused on the mechanistic study of the life of the cell at the molecular level. The curriculum is interdisciplinary and includes courses in physics, chemistry, and genetics in addition to molecular and cellular biology. Training in these areas is beneficial for careers in biological research, a number of high tech industries, medicine, and allied health professions. This challenging major requires creativity, rigor, and the ability to analyze, distill, and interpret data. A love of living systems and a level of comfort with complexity are both essential. Due to the extensive overlap in curricula, Cell and Molecular Biology majors cannot double major in Biological Chemistry. Students can double major in Cell and Molecular Biology and Neuroscience, but there are additional requirements that must be met beyond those requirements for most double major combinations. Students majoring in cell and molecular biology must complete a minimum of eleven courses in the biology components, totaling at least 25 credits; 16 credits in chemistry; and 8 credits of physics with laboratories. Students must also complete Calculus ( MATH 1210 Calculus I (4 c.h.) or MATH 1310 Consolidated Calculus (4 c.h.) ) and Statistics for Scientists ( MATH 1230 Stats For Scientists (4 c.h.) ) to satisfy the major and BS requirements.

      "Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, MS Overview Requirements The Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering Department offers both a thesis and non-thesis option for obtaining a master’s degree. Graduate students receiving financial support as research or teaching assistants can earn a M.S. degree only with the approval of Department Chair and SSE Associate Dean for Graduate Studies, and in general, a written thesis is required. Tenure is five years, although completion of all requirements for the degree for full-time students in two years is strongly encouraged. For the thesis option, the student must complete 24 hours of graduate course work plus conduct a research investigation under the guidance of a faculty member. Typically, two years are required to finish the course work and thesis. Upon completion, the student must defend a thesis before a faculty committee, which is chosen as described for PhD. students. For the non-thesis option, a total of 30 hours of course work is required. For both degree options, three core graduate chemical engineering courses are required: CENG 7110 (Modern Thermodynamics); CENG 7320 (Advanced Transport Phenomena); and either CENG 7150 (Advanced Reactor Design) or CENG 6870 (Biomolecular and Cellular Engineering), with up to six independent study credits toward the 24/30 credit requirement.

      "Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, PhD Overview Requirements The Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering Department offers a Doctor of Philosophy degree, in which students perform cutting edge research in advanced engineering topics. Graduate students pursuing PhD studies are supported as research or teaching assistants. The PhD degree culminates in an open defense of a written dissertation based on the original research performed by the student. A master’s degree is not a prerequisite to the beginning of study for the Doctor of Philosophy degree. Completing the Ph.D. requirements normally requires five years of full-time study beyond the B.S. degree. The Ph.D. degree requires a student to reach a critical understanding of the basic scientific and engineering principles underlying their field of interest. In addition, the student must demonstrate the ability to conduct independently an intensive research project and document their results in the form of refereed publications, presentations, and a final thesis dissertation. Specifically, candidates for the Ph.D. degree must: Complete a minimum of 48 credit hours of approved course work; Pass a qualifying examination; Present an acceptable dissertation prospectus to a dissertation committee; Make an original contribution to the field of chemical engineering in the form of a dissertation suitable for publication; and Defend the dissertation during a public presentation. The Ph.D. degree requires 48 hours of approved graduate course work plus a thesis. These courses must include three core graduate chemical engineering courses: Course List Course ID Title Credits CENG 7110 Modern Thermodynamics 3 CENG 7320 Advanced Transport Phenomena 3 CENG 7150 Advanced Reactor Design 3 or CENG 6870 Biomolecular & Cellular Engr CENG 7010 Graduate Mentoring Seminar I 1 CENG 7020 Graduate Mentoring Seminar II 1 Ph.D. candidates are also allowed 25 independent study credits toward the 48 credit requirement. Ph.D. candidates who have completed an M.S. at another institution will be potentially allowed to transfer a small number of credit hours toward the Ph.D. Frequently, students without an undergraduate chemical engineering degree will enroll in the graduate program. To ensure that all students are familiar with the fundamental principles required of chemical engineers, students entering the graduate program with a bachelor's degree in an area other than chemical engineering will be required to take four undergraduate courses—Unit Operations I, II and III, and one of either Reactor Design, Process Control or Process Design. On the recommendation of the Graduate Committee, these requirements can be modified based on each student's specific background. These undergraduate courses do not count toward the total graduate-level credit requirement for the advanced degree. Graduate students may take these courses out of sequence and/or concurrently in order to expedite completion of this requirement. Completing the Ph.D. requirements normally requires four to five years of full-time study beyond the B.S. degree. Students already possessing an M.S. degree in chemical engineering typically require one year less time. Financial aid is given to all full time graduate students working towards the doctoral degree.\n",

An Engineering Elective is any non-required CENG course, a course offered by one of the engineering departments (BMEN, ENGP), or a course offered by Computer Science (COSC and CMPS). Advanced Specialization Electives are typically selected from the following list: • Any 3000-level or above CENG, BMEN, CHEM, CMPS, COSC, ENGP, MATH, MPEN, or PHYS • CELL 3030: Molecular Biology • CELL 3750: Cell Biology (pre-req: CELL 3030) • EENS 4250: Isotopes in the Environment • EENS 4360: Environmental Geochemistry (pre-req: EENS 2110) • ENRG 4100: Energy Markets, Economics, and Policy • ENRG 4110: Energy Financial Modeling • ENRG 4200: Energy Fundamentals and Trading • SPHU 3160: Biostatistics in Public Health (pre-req: SPHU 1010 and 1020) • SPHU 4160: Intro to Statistical Packages (pre-req: SPHU 3160) • SPHU 4400: Practical Bioinformatics • SPHU 4410: Data & Information Management in Public Health (pre-req: SPHU 1010 and 1020) Any Substitutions must follow the Petition for Degree Plan Modification process. Technical electives, Engineering electives, and Advanced Specialization electives must each satisfy a minimum of 6 credit hours, and at least 3 credit hours of Technical and Engineering electives must be at the 3000-level or above. For all electives, the courses must be of at least the same technical rigor as the first freshman-level course we require from that department (i.e., General Chemistry for CHEM courses, General Physics for PHYS courses, Calculus I for MATH courses. CELL 1010 is the benchmark for CELL courses). Additionally, courses containing significant overlap with core curriculum are excluded (list found here). Students are encouraged to inquire with their CBE Advisor or the Undergraduate Committee Chair if they are unsure about a potential elective. Note that a maximum of 3-credit hours can be satisfied from Professional Development Courses. Courses for non-science majors will not fulfill the elective requirements. **Students may take courses from a biochemistry series offered by either Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering (CENG 4450 and 4460) or Chemistry (CHEM 3830 and 3840) to satisfy one or both courses of the Advanced Specialization Elective requirement. Once a biochemistry course has been taken and a grade of D- or better has been granted, the parallel course from the other department cannot be taken to satisfy any elective requirement for the Chemical Engineering degree. As an example, a student who withdraws from CHEM 3830 can take CENG 4450 to satisfy the first Advanced Specialization requirement. If the student then goes on to earn credit for both CENG 4460 and CHEM 3840, one of the courses can be used for elective credit but the other ‘biochemistry II’ course will not be counted as an elective, technical or otherwise.\n",

Students unable to complete 6 cumes in 6 semesters will be automatically placed in the  M.S. program and be expected to complete the M.S. thesis by the end of the seventh semester. Seminar Registration for, and attendance at, Department seminars is required.  Students are required to register for Division Seminar every semester until they have been admitted to candidacy.  Six (6.0) hours of credit for seminar courses may be applied to the Ph.D. degree requirements.  All Ph.D. candidates must present a seminar to the Department based upon a topic from the current chemical literature.  The seminar must be presented before the end of the students' 4th semester in residence. The seminar should be scheduled with the Chemistry Department coordinator for seminar programs.  Students presenting seminars are required to enlist two faculty to attend their seminar and provide the faculty with a Seminar Review Form for a written review of the quality of the presentation; the  Seminar Review Form can be obtained from the department website.   Students should remember that faculty will only agree to attend if given sufficient notice (one month minimum) before the seminar. Tenure Requirement The maximum time allowed by the SSE Graduate Program for completion of the Ph.D. degree is seven years. The Department, however, strongly encourages students to attempt to complete requirements in no more than five years. Dissertation Committee After choosing a research advisor (no later than the second semester of residence), students must obtain agreements from a minimum of three chemistry faculty members (other than the dissertation advisor) to participate as members of their dissertation committee.  Two members must be within the division of the research advisor and one member of the committee must be from a division in the Chemistry Department other than that of the research advisor.  Students must submit to the Chemistry Department a signed and completed Thesis / Dissertation Committee Form . The form can be obtained on the department’s website. Dissertation Prospectus By the end of the fifth semester, students must submit a written proposal of their dissertation research project and make an oral presentation of it to their dissertation committee.  The prospectus should be approximately two thousand words in length (excluding legends and references). The cover sheet should state the student’s name, department/program, the title of the proposed dissertation, and the name of the chair and the other members of the committee. The introduction of the prospectus should contain a summary of earlier work on the problem in question. The body should include an orderly description of the work accomplished to date and a plan for future investigations. The conclusion should clearly state the anticipated nature of the investigation results. Major sources of information should be indicated and a selective bibliography attached. The prospectus should be submitted to the SSE Dean's Office along with a signed copy of the prospectus approval form. Admission to Candidacy Prior to the dissertation, an application for admission to candidacy should be filed with the SSE.  This should be done approximately one semester before the final dissertation.  Deadlines are posted on the SSE website. Dissertation The Ph. D dissertation must reflect the ability of the student to conduct an independent investigation which results in an original contribution to knowledge or an original interpretation of existing knowledge. The research is expected to be reported to the scientific community in the form of publications in refereed journals and/or conference presentations. The student should consult the SSE Dean's office to determine the proper format for the Ph.D. dissertation. Upon completion of all other Ph.D. requirements, the student will  give a final oral defense of their Ph.D. dissertation. A written draft of the dissertation should be available to the dissertation committee two weeks prior to the oral defense.  This final examination will consist principally of the defense of the dissertation, but may be extended at the discretion of the Ph.D. examining committee to include course material. The satisfactory completion of this final requirement completes the student's doctoral program.\n",

The intellectual focus of the CCC program is unique in bringing together interdisciplinary approaches in the social sciences, social work, architecture, law, and humanities and applying them to understand a range of issues pertaining to cities, cultures, and communities. CCC's breadth of interdisciplinary study allows students considerable flexibility to tailor their training to individual research interests while providing some depth of disciplinary training in the tracks that individual students follow: sociology, social work, and urban studies. Students must complete 53 hours of course work comprised of 24 hours of elective credits and 29 hours of required credits. For more information about the program, please consult the CCC Graduate Student Handbook. The CCC curriculum and research training give students an interdisciplinary conceptual and practical basis to study the dynamics of urban, cultural, and community change in international and comparative terms and frameworks. By interconnecting interdisciplinary and disciplinary education and training, CCC faculty members encourage graduate students to select dissertation topics that offer the potential for a cross-disciplinary approach with the Ph.D. degree awarded in “Sociology – CCC,” “Social Work – CCC,” or “Urban Studies - CCC.” The  program is designed to prepare students for professional careers in academic and non-academic settings. CCC's three principle goals are (1) to produce highly educated researchers with advanced theoretical and methodological skills and flexibility to compete in the academic, governmental, non-profit, private, and public sectors, or some combination; (2) to develop partnerships between faculty and students to extend scholarship in important areas of research, creativity, and practice to benefit the New Orleans community and society-at-large; and (3) to create new methods, theories, and innovative approaches to address the world's most challenging urban, environmental, and sustainability problems.

      "Civil Engineering-Water Resources and Environmental Minor Overview Requirements CIM Program Description The Minor in Civil Engineering -Water Resources and Environmental is available to students pursuing any undergraduate major in the School of Science and Engineering or in other Tulane schools.  In particular, students majoring in another engineering discipline may find the RCSE minor attractive as an additional skill set for the job market. Students with a major in the physical or environmental sciences might have already covered the pre- or co-requisites for the RCSE minor, making it a relatively easy addition to their expertise while matriculating at Tulane. Students majoring in the environmental sciences (e.g., EEB or EES) could strengthen their undergraduate training in water-related topics. Outside of SSE, any student interested in a career linked to environmental planning, climate change adaptations, the resilience of human and natural systems, and water utilization could benefit from this training. This umbrella includes fields as diverse as law, business, public health, and social sciences. We foresee particular links for students in the (1) Environmental Studies major (School of Liberal Arts), where strengthening their science and engineering background in the water sector would be advantageous in many career tracks, and (2) in the School of Architecture, where a program in landscape architecture and design is under development. The Minor in Civil Engineering - Water Resources and Engineering requires 18 credit hours from the following six courses: Course List Course ID Title Credits ENGP 1410 Statics 3 RCSE 3010 Water Resources Engineering - I (Or) 3 or BMEN 3440 Biofluid Mechanics or CENG 2320 Transport Phenomena I RCSE 4010 Water Resources Engineering II 3 RCSE 4030 Water Resources Engineering III 3 RCSE 6800 Intro to River Science & Eng (offered every Spring) 3 RCSE 6802 Introduction to Coastal Science and Engineering (offered Fall semester) 3 Total Credit Hours 18 In summary, to complete the RCSE minor, students using RCSE3010 or BMEN 2320 for the fluid mechanics requirement will also need to successfully complete one semester each of calculus and physics. If using CENG23230, they will need three semesters of math (including 2 of calculus), one of physics, one of chemistry, and an additional CENG course (Thermodynamics). Likely the latter track to the RCSE minor will primarily be followed by students seeking a major in chemical engineering. As further requirements for the RCSE minor, students must maintain a 2.00 GPA in all minor courses. No courses can count toward a second minor in SSE or other Tulane schools.  For more information, please contact the department chair at meadallison@tulane.edu .\n",

      "Classical Studies Major, BA Overview Requirements The study of the cultures of ancient Greece and Rome is inherently valuable, and it also offers an opportunity for critical reflection on our own society and its values. The field of classical studies combines history, literature, archaeology, art history, law, and linguistics, and so is fundamentally interdisciplinary in character. The study of Greece and Rome thus provides students with an historical perspective on and better understanding of the institutions, values, and intellectual traditions of the world in which we live. Our students gain an understanding not only of various aspects of the ancient world but also of the methodologies of classical studies can work separately and together to widen and deepen our comprehension of human cultures in all periods. Through the major program in Classical Studies, we aim to educate students in the cultures of the ancient Mediterranean world through the study of Greek and Roman texts in translation and ancient material culture. In addition, since we emphasize research and writing in all of our classes, we seek to foster our students’ intellectual curiosity and to develop their skills in analysis and communication. For more information about the Department of Classical Studies please visit our website. Classical Studies (CLAS) Majors need 30* credits in CLAS, GREK, and/or LATN courses * 27 credits, if the student has multiple majors. Students may take courses entirely in translation, i.e., all CLAS courses, or they can pursue a mix of courses in one or both ancient languages (GREK and/or LATN) and in translation. Because there are no required courses that majors must complete, students can build a major around their interests, concentrating on literary studies, history, or archaeology, for example. At least 9 credits must be earned from courses at the 4000 level.

      "Classical Studies, MA Overview Requirements Classical Studies focuses on understanding the world of the ancient Mediterranean—including Greece, Rome, and surrounding cultures—by studying its languages, history, art, and archaeology. Our program focuses on developing skills in critical thinking, reading, and writing, and our students find that exploring the past invites new perspectives on the modern world while opening doors to the future. Tulane's M.A. program in Classical Studies prepares students for further academic work in Ph.D. programs, for teaching in secondary schools, and for other types of careers. We emphasize building our graduate students' skills in Latin and Greek, while encouraging them to explore the ancient world through archaeology and ancient history. Our small, selective, and highly personalized program makes Tulane an excellent choice for those who are ready to engage deeply with the ancient Mediterranean in all its complexity. For more information about the Department of Classical Studies please visit our website. The Department of Classical Studies at Tulane offers two types of post-undergraduate work: M.A. Program Our M.A. program emphasizes preparation in Latin and Greek and can include coursework in ancient history, archaeology, philosophy, and ancient religion. The program typically requires two years for completion. In the first year, most students take three courses within the department per semester. In the second year, students might either take two courses per semester and work on the M.A. thesis or take three courses while substantially revising two earlier seminar papers into M.A. qualifying papers. We offer our best qualified applicants a full tuition fellowship and annual stipend. The requirements for the M.A. degree are: A minimum of 30 semester hours of graduate-level credit (typically 10 courses) completed with a minimum grade of B. Typically, students complete 12 – 16 courses during the two-year program. Two qualifying papers or an M.A. thesis, either of which must be defended before a committee of three faculty members. Satisfactory completion of a reading exam in a modern language (German, French, or Italian). We expect students without preparation in a modern language (excluding English) to enroll in undergraduate language courses as part of their M.A. coursework. Traditionally, for each semester during their first year, students will take one Latin course, one Greek course, one classics course, and if required one modern language course.  In their second year for each semester, students will take one Latin course, one Greek course, one classics course or thesis research, and if required one modern language course. We encourage our students to travel abroad between the first and second years, either to academic programs like those led by the American School of Classical Studies at Athens or the American Academy in Rome, or to archaeological field projects. Funding is available for such travel to all graduate students in good standing. 4+1 M.A. Program in Classics Majors in the department who are pursuing the B.A. degree in Greek, Latin, or Classical Studies may wish to earn the M.A. degree through an additional, fifth year at Tulane. Entry into the 4+1 program must occur no later than the first semester of the senior undergraduate year. Students interested in teaching Latin might pursue the 4+1 as part of their pathway toward that goal. The requirements for the 4+1 M.A. are the same as those for the post-baccalaureate M.A. program described above. Note: a maximum of two (2) graduate-level courses of the minimum ten graduate-level courses needed for the M.A may be taken as part of the undergraduate major. Students can take up to 12 graduate credit hours (4 courses) beyond the courses needed for the undergraduate degree, if they have completed all undergraduate degree requirements; however, a minimum of two graduate-level courses must be completed by the end of the fourth (senior) undergraduate year. HOW TO APPLY to the graduate programs (M.A. and 4+1): Undergraduate majors in Classics, History, Art History, Archaeology, and related fields are invited to apply. We particularly welcome applications from students with backgrounds historically underrepresented in Classical Studies.  If you have questions about expectations and/or your preparation, please contact the Director of Graduate studies. All applicants must complete the graduate studies application form and submit the application fee. The application form is available at the School of Liberal Arts website. Applicants to the regular two-year M.A. program must submit: a statement of purpose (c. 500 words) three (3) letters of recommendation a writing sample of no more than 20 pages Applicants to the 4+1 program must submit a statement of purpose (c. 500 words) two (2) letters of recommendation a writing sample of no more than 20 pages NOTE: applicants to the 4+1 do not need to submit GRE scores, but they must have an overall minimum GPA of 3.0, and a minimum GPA of 3.5 in the major (Classical Studies, Latin, and/or Greek).

      "Composition, BFA Overview Requirements Music composition is about creativity, imagination, communication and collaboration. It requires highly developed multilinear critical analytical skills, excellent organizational skills and a great deal of attention to detail. Music brings people from different backgrounds and communities together, enhances creativity, develops imaginations and helps you to make emotional connections with people. Several of our Music Composition program alumni have had highly successful and diverse careers as composers of abstract music and as faculty members and administrators at major institutions. Many others have successfully aligned their creative endeavors with interdisciplinary pursuits in areas such as multimedia, music for film, music therapy, music business, music and management, or entertainment law. Over the years, the Music Composition program has also graduated many alumni who have had highly successful careers in other diverse disciplines: from the sciences, to medicine, to finance, mathematics, and management. Our Music Composition majors are expected to take composition lessons for at least six semesters, study orchestration and take classes in music theory, music history, electronic music and computer music. Graduating seniors are required to present a senior composition recital which involves 60 minutes of original music and demonstrates their ability to function as independent composers. Music Composition majors also participate in ensembles and are strongly encouraged to take instrument lessons. Piano proficiency, in particular, is generally considered as an invaluable tool for composition. Though it is not required, composition majors are encouraged to take Composition for Electronic Media and other electronic and computer music courses through the Music Science and Technology program. Composition for Electronic Media examines theoretical and practical aspects of the study of computer and electro-acoustic music composition. Through individual composition projects, this course focuses on developing computer and electro-acoustic compositional techniques with projects in pre-recorded material manipulation, sound synthesis and analysis, music signal processing, algorithmic composition, and music performance systems design, to name a few. There are many other courses offered in the Music Science and Technology that we encourage composition majors to take in order to strengthen their foundations in composing with electronic media. These include Introduction to Computer Applications in Music, Music and Digital Signal Processing, and Algorithmic and Computer Music. For more information regarding these courses please see the Music, Science, & Technology program description. Our music complex includes a 1,000-seat auditorium, Dixon Hall, a 200-seat recital hall, Dixon Recital Hall, a choral hall, a band room, two computer music labs, and practice rooms that are available 24/7 by student ID card access for students enrolled in music courses. At the end of Spring 2019, construction of a new state-of-the-art recording and electronic music studio will begin. This will be available for use after taking the required training for use of the studio. As the Newcomb Music Department is an All-Steinway School, all of our practice and performance spaces are equipped with Steinway pianos. The University also owns a wide range of other instruments which are available for students to borrow.

      "Computer Science Certificate Overview Requirements The Undergraduate Certificate in Computer Science offers students from across the university to develop a strong understanding of the fundamentals of computer science and programming that will increase their competitiveness for future jobs and/or post-baccalaureate studies. The certificate must be attached to a degree and cannot be earned as an independent certificate. The certificate also cannot be earned in addition to the traditional Coordinate Major in Computer Science; students can earn one or the other, but not both. The requirements for the Undergraduate Certificate in Computer Science are highly flexible to provide students the opportunity to specialize their study in ways that complement their chosen major. It also offers students the opportunity to take a few courses in computer science before deciding whether or not to go for the full major. The certificate will require 3-4 semesters to complete as there is a one year sequence of introductory classes that must be taken in order. There are multiple entry and exit points for students wishing to pursue the certificate. Students who begin by pursuing the Computer Science Coordinate Major will enter with CMPS 1500 Intro to Computer Science I (4 c.h.) , which is a more rigorous course that sets students up for success in CMPS 2200 Intro to Algorithms (3 c.h.) and later courses required for the Major. However, students who are more “computer science curious” can enter with CMPS 1100 Foundations of Programming (3 c.h.) followed by CMPS 3160 Introduction to Data Science (3 c.h.) which will provide them with a comparable foundation at a gentler pace. Students that have a firm desire to take only a small number of advanced CMPS courses, e.g., Machine Learning, Bioinformatics, or Computational Geometry, can take a sequence consisting of CMPS 1500 Intro to Computer Science I (4 c.h.) , CMPS 1600 Intro to Computer Science II (4 c.h.) , CMPS 2200 Intro to Algorithms (3 c.h.) , and then the specific higher level elective. The Undergraduate Certificate in Computer Science requires the completion of a minimum of 12 credit hours (CR) consisting of the following. Note that the certificate must be attached to an undergraduate degree and cannot be earned as an independent certificate. The certificate also cannot be earned in addition to the traditional Coordinate Major in Computer Science; students can earn one or the other, but not both.

      "Computer Science Coordinate Major Overview Requirements The Tulane Computer Science Coordinate Major program helps students develop into leaders who are able to solve interdisciplinary problems using the tools of computer science and computing technology. What is a coordinate major? A coordinate major is an additional major designed to complement the primary one. To earn a coordinate major in computer science, students must also complete a major in another discipline. Any undergraduate major at Tulane can serve as a primary major for the computer science coordinate major. Upon successful completion of the coordinate major, the student’s transcript will reflect the fact that the student has completed the coordinate major in computer science with a focus on the area of application. The Department of Computer Science doesn’t currently offer a standalone Bachelor of Science in Computer Science degree or computer science minor. While this might change in the future, students should not count on the possibility of either when deciding on enrolling at Tulane or in computer science courses. The undergraduate degree (Bachelor of Science or Bachelor of Arts) received by the student is determined by their primary major. Other computing courses Students interested in computing, but not in pursuing the coordinate major, are invited to consider our foundational courses for non-majors, such as CMPS 1100 Foundations of Programming (3 c.h.) and a Maymester course, CMPS 2120 Programming and Prob Solving (3 c.h.) . About the department More info about the Department of Computer Science and the program is available on the department webpage . Coursework The program comprises 10 courses: Five introductory core courses, CMPS 1500 Intro to Computer Science I (4 c.h.) , CMPS 1600 Intro to Computer Science II (4 c.h.) , CMPS 2170 Intro to Discrete Math (3 c.h.) , CMPS 2200 Intro to Algorithms (3 c.h.) , and CMPS 2300 Intro to Comp Sys & Networking (3 c.h.) . At least three CMPS elective classes at the 3000-level or above. A two-semester interdisciplinary capstone project, CMPS 4010 Capstone Project 1 of 2 (2 c.h.) and CMPS 4020 Capstone Project Part 2 of 2 (2 c.h.) . These courses total 30 credit hours and can be completed over five or more semesters. Two starting classes for the program are CMPS 1500 Intro to Computer Science I (4 c.h.) and CMPS 2170 Intro to Discrete Math (3 c.h.) . CMPS 1500 Intro to Computer Science I (4 c.h.) , CMPS 1600 Intro to Computer Science II (4 c.h.) , CMPS 2170 Intro to Discrete Math (3 c.h.) , and CMPS 2200 Intro to Algorithms (3 c.h.) are currently offered twice a year, once each fall and spring. CMPS 2300 Intro to Comp Sys & Networking (3 c.h.) is currently offered once a year, in the spring. These five core courses should be completed before the student's senior/final year at Tulane. CMPS 4010 Capstone Project I (2 c.h.) and CMPS 4020 Capstone Project II (2 c.h.) are each offered once a year, in the fall and in the spring, respectively. The capstone is usually completed in the senior year. Students continuing to 4 + 1 Master's programs in other departments are encouraged to complete the capstone in the senior year, but are allowed to complete the capstone in their final year at Tulane. Students graduating early enroll in the capstone in the junior year. A two-semester Honor’s Thesis in Computer Science can be used in place of the Capstone Project requirement. Academic requirements In order to enroll in the senior capstone course, the student should achieve a cumulative GPA of 2.8 or above for the five introductory core courses. In order to graduate with the coordinate major in computer science, the student should achieve a cumulative GPA of 2.8 or above in all CMPS courses. Declaring the coordinate major To declare the coordinate major in computer science, please complete and sign the major declaration form and email it to Ms. Debbie Ramil ( dramil1@tulane.edu ), who will assign you a coordinate major advisor, obtain the corresponding advisor's and the departmental chairman's signatures for your form, and return the form to you. The completed form needs to be submitted to the Advising Office. When you declare your pursuit of the coordinate major, you should have already declared your primary major. When the major declaration form is processed, you will be added to the CS students mailing list. In order to enhance your CS education, you may also wish to join computing-focused student organizations, such as Cookies and Code and Women in Technology (their info is on WaveSync).

Academic prerequisites The program is open to all students willing to put time and work into becoming computing professionals. It doesn’t assume that students have any previous computer science background. Many of our graduates have never programmed a computer before joining their first computer science class. The department holds several help sessions most days of the week to provide help to students when they have questions while working on computer science homework. Prior computing experience Advanced Placement (AP) computer science courses taken by a student in high school usually transfer toward overall college credit. (This is decided by the Tulane University Office of Undergraduate Admissions.) These courses do not have much overlap with our introductory courses and hence don’t count toward the coordinate major. If a student can demonstrate solid knowledge of the material covered in one of the required courses, after consultation with their faculty advisor, they can “skip” the required course and replace it with a CMPS elective of their choice instead. The minimum total number of completed CMPS courses should remain 10. Transfer coursework Transfer of college-level courses follows the standard Tulane credit transfer procedure. There is no special department-level limit on the number of courses that can transfer; we adhere to the limit established by Newcomb-Tulane College. In order for a course from another university to count for the coordinate major, it should match a corresponding Tulane course in content and/or complexity; mode of delivery (online, in-person, hybrid) doesn’t affect this evaluation. Computing courses on subjects not offered by Tulane might be transferrable. Students should confirm with the Department of Computer Science whether the course would transfer as a coordinate major course before registering. Study abroad With advanced planning, it may be possible to study abroad and complete the coordinate major. Students should confirm with the Department of Computer Science whether and how the foreign courses would transfer before registering. Programming languages We often get asked what programming languages we teach. In fact, we teach principles, concepts, and problem-solving approaches rather than specific languages. CMPS 1500 is in Python. CMPS 1600 uses Java, C, C++, Haskell, and a surprise language. The elective courses use a language that’s necessary to achieve the tasks of the course (e.g. Javascript, Scala, Ruby). Our successful students get used to learning new languages and are able to study the basics of any computer language on their own. Computer specifications Another common area of inquiry is about buying a computer. It is helpful and convenient to have a laptop. We don’t have a computer lab, and students work on their own laptops to complete most programming assignments. Model and make don’t matter; any modern laptop with Wi-Fi and a battery works. If buying or bringing a laptop is problematic, all necessary work can be done on university stationary computers or loaner laptops. It is possible to do well in all computer science courses without owning a computer.\n",

      "Computer Science, MS Overview Requirements The Master's Program in Computer Science is offered in coursework and thesis tracks. The coursework option requires both breadth and depth requirements. The breadth requirement ensures students obtain a solid foundation in core computer science areas, while the depth requirement allows students to design a sequence of courses to target a particular area of interest. The thesis track further allows students to conduct research in a chosen area of interest. The Master’s degree can also be pursued in a 4+1 format in conjunction with the Coordinate major in Computer Science. The M.S. program requires 30 credit hours of graduate coursework. Coursework requirements vary slightly depending on the chosen track, but consist of 12 credits of breadth coursework and 12-18 credits of depth coursework. Below we outline these degree tracks with their associated course requirements and provide some example curricula. We note that some of these example curricula do not have full-time enrollment in all semesters. Additional electives can be added in these slots as needed for full-time requirements. Coursework and Degree Tracks At the high level, the course requirements for the M.S. can be thought of as having a core requirement and an elective requirement . The core requirement is identical to that of our Ph.D. program, which requires of one core course from each of three breadth areas (Algorithms, Systems and Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning), for a total of three courses counting for 9 credit hours. Currently the Algorithms area requirement is fulfilled by CMPS 6610 Algorithms (3 c.h.) (Algorithms), the Systems area is fulfilled by CMPS 6750 Computer Networks (3 c.h.) or CMPS 6760 Distributed Systems (3 c.h.) (Distributed Systems), and the AI/ML area requirement is fulfilled by CMPS 6620 Artificial Intelligence (3 c.h.) (Artificial Intelligence) or CMPS 6720 Machine Learning (3 c.h.) (Machine Learning). The available degree tracks are the coursework , project and thesis tracks; each of these can also be completed in the 4+1 format for existing coordinate majors. Depending on the chosen option, the remaining 21 credit hours can be fulfilled by some combination of CS electives and thesis work. A CS graduate elective is any CS course that is 6000-level or higher, other than CMPS 7010 Research Seminar (3 c.h.) (Research Seminar). Core courses not counted toward the core requirement also can count toward elective requirements. A comprehensive list of current courses can be found here. Finally, thesis work can be conducted by taking CMPS 9980 Masters Research (0 to 3 c.h.) (Master’s Thesis) over two semesters for a grade. In both the coursework and thesis options we seek to encourage elective choices that are coherent enough to provide a specialized area of study, but flexible enough that students can explore different areas of computer science. Below we give examples of each track with sample curricula. Coursework and Project Tracks . The 21 credit hours remaining after taking core courses for the coursework only track consists of 7 courses. In some instances, it may be possible to submit a petition to the Graduate Studies Committee to count non-CS courses for elective credit (e.g., in an interdisciplinary subject area). No more than 2 such graduate courses may be counted toward M.S. coursework credit.

      "Computer Science, PhD Overview Requirements The PhD Program in Computer Science guides students from beginning graduate study in Computer Science all the way through to completion of their dissertation research. The objective of the program is to ensure students obtain a solid foundation by requiring them to take graduate courses in a number of core areas of computer science. A depth requirement involving the attendance of a sequence of courses from one or more areas will enable the student to acquire world-class expertise on a research area of concentration. Students also will be expected to engage in research as early as their incoming semester. This will be accomplished by the research courses and research seminars that will prepare students by engaging them in research from the start. More detailed information about the PhD program can be found on the following program page: https://sse.tulane.edu/cs/academics/graduate/phd-programs . The program requires 48 credit hours of graduate course work, including core computer science courses, research courses starting in the first year, as well as an interdisciplinary research project. After an oral qualifying examination at the end of the fifth semester, the prospectus presentation is scheduled at the beginning of the seventh semester, and the final milestone is to complete and defend a dissertation. Course requirements are broken down into four areas: core courses, research courses, the interdisciplinary project and electives. Students are required to complete at least 48 credit hours (typically 16 classes) of coursework. This consists of: 9 credit hours of core classes 9 credit hours of research courses in the first two years 9 credit hours for the interdisciplinary project 9 credit hours of Computer Science electives 12 credit hours of general electives Each student is required to devise a schedule of courses in consultation with their faculty advisor. Core Courses As a breadth requirement that ensures a good foundation in graduate Computer Science coursework, each PhD student is required to take one class (3 credit hours) in each of the three categories below with a grade point average of at least 3.5 for these three courses. Courses in which an inadequate grade is received may be repeated once. These courses are from the following core areas: Algorithms: CMPS 6610 Algorithms (3 c.h.) Systems: One of CMPS 6750 Computer Networks (3 c.h.) or CMPS 6760 Distributed Systems (3 c.h.) or CMPS 6780 Computer Architecture (3 c.h.) AI/ML: One of CMPS 6620 Artificial Intelligence (3 c.h.) or CMPS 6720 Machine Learning (3 c.h.) The core courses have to be completed before the student's oral qualifying exam. Research Courses in the First Two Years Students are expected to engage in research early on, possibly as early as their incoming semester, but no later than the third semester. This is facilitated through research courses, as well as through the interdisciplinary project. Students are required to take at least three research classes (9 credit hours). Typically, these classes consist of CMPS 7010 Research Seminar (3 c.h.) in the first year, and one offering of CMPS 7020 Research in Computer Science (3 c.h.) in the second year. CMPS 7010 Research Seminar (3 c.h.) introduces students to research methods in Computer Science and to the research conducted in the department. In the CMPS 7020 Research in Computer Science (3 c.h.) course PhD students engage in a research project in Computer Science, under the direction of a faculty member, normally the student's faculty advisor. Interdisciplinary Project Each student is required to complete an interdisciplinary research project. The project is directed by a faculty member in Computer Science, and it consists of interdisciplinary research in a related area. During the rst-year research seminar classes, students are exposed to the research areas represented by the department faculty. Students are encouraged to identify a faculty advisor and a research topic for their interdisciplinary project during these seminar classes. If a student is unable to identify a project, the Graduate Studies Committee assigns a faculty mentor to advise the student and help develop an interdisciplinary project. The requirements for the interdisciplinary project are: Students must take one graduate class (3 credits or more) in Computer Science that prepares them for the project. Examples include CMPS 6630 Computational Bio & Bioinform (3 c.h.) , CMPS 6360 Data Visualization (3 c.h.) , CMPS 6640 Adv. Computational Geometry (3 c.h.) , CMPS 6150 Multi-agent Systems (3 c.h.) . Students must take one graduate class (3 credits or more) outside of Computer Science in the area most relevant to the interdisciplinary project. Students must enroll in a directed research course (3 credits), such as CMPS 7020 Research in Computer Science (3 c.h.) , to conduct the interdisciplinary research. The project culminates in a final report, possibly a published research paper, that summarizes the research outcomes. Students also are required to present the outcomes of their project in a public talk in the department. Typically, students are exposed to interdisciplinary research during their first year in research seminar classes. They start the interdisciplinary project in their third semester, and the expectation is that the project is completed by the end of the second year. Elective Courses The following elective courses are part of the PhD requirements: Computer Science electives: Students are required to enroll in 9 credit hours of graduate courses in Computer Science, chosen from PhD-level classes except for CMPS 7010 Research Seminar (3 c.h.) , CMPS 7020 Research in Computer Science (3 c.h.) , CMPS 7980 Independent Study (3 c.h.) . General electives: Students are required to enroll in 12 credit hours of general electives that can be CMPS 7020 Research in Computer Science (3 c.h.) or graduate courses in Computer Science, chosen from PhD-level classes except for CMPS 7010 Research Seminar (3 c.h.) . With approval of the Graduate Studies Committee, at most 9 credit hours of general electives may be replaced with graduate electives outside of Computer Science. Faculty Advisor and PhD Committee The student's faculty advisor and PhD committee oversee the research portion of the student's PhD program. Since students are expected to conduct directed research early in the program, they are encouraged to identify a faculty advisor and their dissertation research topic as soon as possible but no later than the end of their second year. The advisor often will be the faculty member advising the student on the interdisciplinary research project. Once a student selects a faculty advisor for their dissertation, that advisor serves as the main point of contact for the student. During the student's fourth semester, the student and the faculty advisor draft a proposed list of members of the student's PhD committee. The proposed committee must be approved by the Graduate Studies Committee. Initially, the PhD committee consists of at least three faculty members: the Computer Science faculty advisor and two additional faculty members. One committee member may be a Tulane faculty member from outside the Computer Science department, as appropriate. This committee administers the qualifying oral examination, attends the prospectus presentation and approves the written prospectus, and attends the thesis defense. During the summer before the student's third year, a fourth member of the committee is recruited. This member must be external to Tulane. The external committee member must attend the student's prospectus presentation, approve the written thesis and attend the thesis defense. The PhD Committee provides advice and guidance throughout the student's course of study, oversees the qualifying exam, the prospectus, and the dissertation defense. Oral Qualifying Exam and Prospectus Major milestones of the PhD program are the oral qualifying exam and the prospectus, including the prospectus presentation. The oral qualifying exam typically takes place in the the fifth semester, administered by the PhD committee. Before taking the oral qualifying exam the student must have completed the core requirements as well as the interdisciplinary project. The PhD committee compiles a reading list the student is responsible for in the oral qualifying exam. The purpose of this exam is to ensure the student is qualified to do independent research. The student is tested over a set of selected topics related to the student's research area. The student is informed about the material covered on the exam during the semester preceding the exam. The exam may start with a short presentation by the student and is followed by questions from the committee. The oral qualifying exam must be passed before the end of the fifth semester; it can be retaken at most once. At the beginning of the student's seventh semester, the PhD committee { the original three members and the external fourth member { attend an oral prospectus presentation given by the student. In the presentation, the student describes the central problem that will be addressed in the dissertation, including the background needed to place the problem properly in perspective. The purpose of the presentation is to give the student feedback about the proposed problem and to suggest additional issues that may be relevant to the proposed research. A final written prospectus of 3-5 pages in length that describes the proposed PhD research must be approved by the PhD committee and submitted to the School of Science and Engineering, no later than the end of the semester in which the prospectus presentation takes place. Dissertation Research and the Dissertation After passing the oral qualifying exam, a student focuses primarily on research in a particular area in which they have chosen to do their dissertation research, participating in research projects overseen by their advisor. In many cases, the student co-authors papers in conferences and journals about the research results obtained during these research activities. Then the dissertation will comprise a compilation of the results, with the expectation that the student utilizes the dissertation to present the material as a coherent theme. A draft of the thesis must be circulated to the PhD committee at least one month before the final version is due in the School of Science and Engineering, and the committee will render a verdict on whether the dissertation meets the standards to be accepted for the PhD degree. Example Schedule In this example schedule, 48 credit hours (typically 16 classes of 3 credit hours each) are composed of: 9 credit hours of core classes: Shown as CMPS 6610 Algorithms (3 c.h.) , CMPS 6750 Computer Networks (3 c.h.) , CMPS 6620 Artificial Intelligence (3 c.h.) 9 credit hours of research courses: Shown as two offerings of CMPS 7010 Research Seminar (3 c.h.) and one CMPS 7020 Research in Computer Science (3 c.h.) 9 credit hours for the interdisciplinary project: Shown as CMPS Elective, Non-CMPS Elective, CMPS 7020 Research in Computer Science (3 c.h.) 9 credit hours of Computer Science electives and 12 credit hours of general electives Plan of Study Grid Year 1 Fall Credit Hours CMPS 6610 Algorithms 3 CMPS 6620 Artificial Intelligence 3 CMPS 7010 Research Seminar 3 Credit Hours 9 Spring CMPS 6750 Computer Networks 3 CMPS 7010 Research Seminar 3 CMPS Elective 3 Credit Hours 9 Year 2 Fall CMPS 7020 Research in Computer Science 3 CMPS Elective 3 Non-CMPS Elective 3 Credit Hours 9 Spring CMPS 7020 Research in Computer Science 3 CMPS Elective 3 CMPS Elective 3 Credit Hours 9 Year 3 Fall General Elective 3 General Elective 3 General Elective 3 Credit Hours 9 Spring General Elective 3 Credit Hours 3 Total Credit Hours 48\n",

      "Design, BA Overview Requirements The Bachelor of Arts in Design undergraduate major explores design as mechanism for positive change. Design students learn to integrate multiple aspects of a problem and respond with interdisciplinary solutions to address challenges of an evolving world. Our program centers design as a state of mind for building empathy, humility, and self-awareness — the first steps toward collaborating with other disciplines when solving complex problems. Rather than focusing on one specific aspect of design, our curriculum touches upon all facets within the design discipline (e.g. graphic, fashion, industrial, interior) building relationships between design innovation and engagement with society, culture, and the built environment. Located within the School of Architecture, this program emphasizes design practice across disciplines, including and beyond architecture. Students will learn methods of creative problem-solving, visual communication, and spatial composition through a series of lecture-based and project-based studio courses. The Bachelor of Arts in Design program educates students to apply design thinking across diverse fields in humanities, business, and sciences and invites change-minded students to learn principles of design and methods of creative process to be effective in a range of applications. The major is intended for students interested in an interdisciplinary path through innovative approaches and collaborative projects.

      "Major: Doctor of Juridical Science - Home Content\n",
      "Doctor of Juridical Science Overview Requirements The Doctor of Juridical Science (SJD) program is a small and selective program for students who wish to make an original, significant contribution to legal scholarship. Eligibility​ An applicant for the SJD program must hold an LL.M. degree or its equivalent either from Tulane University or other accredited American universities or foreign universities that the Law School Graduate Affairs Committee (the faculty admissions committee) has ascertained have good standing among the higher education community in the home country. Admission Admission to the SJD candidacy requires the endorsement of the Law School Graduate Affairs Committee. The Committee will examine, along with the student’s performance at the LL.M. or the equivalent qualifying degree level, the strength of the candidate’s proposal to determine whether the individual has the capacity for advanced legal research and for outstanding scholarship. Strong interest in and support of the proposal and the candidacy of the applicant by a Tulane Law School faculty member who is willing to serve as a supervisor will be an important factor in the Committee’s decision. Applicants are strongly encouraged to make every effort to find a supervisor, but they are discouraged from circulating mass letters to the faculty of the Law School. Course of Study Each SJD student is assigned a faculty advisor upon admission. During the first semester of enrollment, SJD students take between 10 and 12 credits of coursework. Thereafter, most SJD students work full-time on the dissertation until it is completed. Tulane’s expectation is that the final SJD dissertation will be submitted within four years following initial enrollment in the program. The dissertation is to make an original and significant contribution to legal scholarship. Each candidate defends his or her dissertation in an oral examination before a committee of the Tulane Law School faculty, supplemented with other University faculty where appropriate. Tulane Law School also offers the Doctor of Juridical Science (SJD) to a small number of candidates who already hold the LLM as well as the first law degree (JD or LLB or equivalent). The SJD is a research-oriented degree requiring completion of a dissertation which makes an original and significant contribution to legal scholarship. Each SJD student is assigned a faculty advisor upon admission. During the first semester of enrollment, SJD students take between 10 and 12 credits of coursework. Thereafter, most SJD students work full-time on the dissertation until it is completed. Tulane’s expectation is that the final SJD dissertation will be submitted within four years following initial enrollment in the program. The dissertation is to make an original and significant contribution to legal scholarship. Each candidate defends his or her dissertation in an oral examination before a committee of the Tulane Law School faculty, supplemented with other University faculty where appropriate. Degree Requirements for the SJD Program: In order to obtain the SJD degree, a student must fulfill the following requirements, depending on the student’s particular circumstances upon admission to the program: Students admitted to the SJD program with a Tulane Law School Master’s degree awarded five or fewer years prior to admission to the SJD program are exempt from any further coursework requirement. Students admitted to the SJD program with a Tulane Master’s degree awarded more than five years prior to admission to the SJD program must complete an additional 10 hours of coursework with a grade of B or better in each course. Students admitted to the SJD program with a Master’s degree from a law school in the United States (other than Tulane) or from an approved foreign law school in all cases must complete an additional 12 hours of coursework at Tulane. All SJD students, including those exempt from some or all further coursework requirements, must be in residence for at least one year but are only required to pay full-time tuition and fees for at least one semester, typically the first semester of enrollment in the program.  Students wishing to enroll in courses outside that one semester may do so on the understanding that they must pay tuition for each additional course they take. Every SJD candidate must write and defend successfully a dissertation which makes an original and significant contribution to legal scholarship.  Unless specifically exempted from this requirement for very exceptional circumstances by the Graduate Programs Committee, the dissertation must be complete and the defense must take place within four years from the initial enrollment in the SJD program. Dissertation Committee: The committee will consist of three members one of whom is the supervisor who acts as the chair of the committee. The chair of the committee shall be a tenured member of the faculty. At least one of the other two members of the committee shall be a tenured or tenure-track member of Tulane Law School. Under normal circumstances, all members of the committee will be Tulane Law School faculty members, but there may be cases where it becomes necessary to ask a faculty member from another department of the University or a faculty member at another institution, foreign or domestic, to join the committee. The outside member must, however, be a tenured member of the faculty at his or her home institution. The selection of the dissertation committee will be decided by the student in consultation with the chair of the committee. The committee shall be empaneled at the earliest time after the candidate has taken residence but no later than the end of the first semester of residence. As soon as the committee has been established, the chair of the committee shall notify the Graduate Affairs Committee of the names of the members of the committee. The Graduate Affairs Committee shall transmit the information to the Assistant Dean for Academic Services for record keeping. Lengths of dissertations vary depending on the subject matter and the writing style of the authors, but as a general matter the length of a dissertation ranges between 200-300 pages, including appendix and bibliography. After the dissertation committee has approved the dissertation, the supervisor shall set up a meeting at which the candidate shall present an oral defense of the doctoral thesis. The dissertation committee will conduct the oral examination. The meeting for the oral defense is open to members of the Law School faculty. Clinical programs, the Trial Advocacy course and externships are not open to SJD students.\n",

      "Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, MS Overview Requirements The Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology offers  the Master of Science degree in both a Thesis and Non-Thesis model (see degree requirements for detail.) The curriculum is designed to encourage maximum student choice and independence while maintaining a close student-advisor relationship. Students are encouraged to adopt a broad, integrative view of science and biological research. Course offerings cover such areas as animal and plant physiology, plant ecology, plant-animal interactions, population biology, structural and evolutionary biology, systematic biology, environmental toxicology, marine/estuarine ecology, and the biology of diverse groups of plants and animals. Students participate in an active departmental seminar program and informal research discussion groups. Achieving our scientific mission is predicated on fostering an inclusive environment that welcomes and supports students, faculty, and staff from marginalized and underrepresented communities, including BIPOC, LGBTQ+, low income, first generation college students and people with disabilities. Academia broadly, and the fields of ecology and evolutionary biology specifically, have a long and well-documented history of racism and exclusivity that continues in many forms to this day. To remove the biases that prevent so many from engaging with, and succeeding in our field, we embrace proactive policies including sensitivity training, targeted funding opportunities, and equal-opportunity hiring and recruiting practices. We consider this work integral to the success of our department, The School of Science and Engineering and Tulane University, and to our academic disciplines. Thesis Model Faculty Advisor The student will consult his/her advisor in order to develop a course of study and to gain the advisor's approval for course registration. The faculty advisor must be a regular (full time) member of the department. The potential applicant should contact the professor who is desired as advisor prior to making application to the Graduate Studies Program in the School of Science and Engineering. Admission to the EEB graduate program depends upon a faculty member committing to supervise the student's graduate program, including the thesis research and composition. Thus, each applicant must have contacted the potential advisor prior to the decision on her/his application for admission. Entrance Interview During the first semester of enrollment, each entering student interviews with the faculty advisor (Graduate Studies Committee Chair substitutes if an advisor has not been arranged) and two other regular faculty members. The purpose of the interview is to review prior courses taken by the student, discuss research interests and degree goals, and ensure that the student understands departmental graduate study procedures. Recommendations for coursework to address deficiencies or to enhance the student's program may be made during the interview. Download Entrance Interview Form .

In general, up to 6 semester hours of transfer credit will be accepted toward the Masters of Science degree. Guidelines for acceptability of transfer credit can be found in the Graduate Catalog of the School of Science and Engineering. The Chair of the Department must approve all transfer credits. Courses taken at Tulane are usually taken in the EEB Department, but as many as nine graduate credits from other departments or divisions may be counted toward the course requirement. Thesis A student's faculty advisor will also be the director of his/her thesis research. A thesis committee must approve the completed thesis. The thesis committee will consist of at least three faculty members including the student's thesis advisor. EEB faculty must comprise a majority of the thesis committee. Each student must request approval for the composition of the thesis committee by letter addressed to the Chair of the Department. The thesis research must be presented to the Department in a public forum and defended at an oral examination conducted by the thesis committee. Specific instructions for thesis preparation are given in the Graduate Catalog of the School of Science and Engineering. Non-Thesis Model (Terminal) In order to earn this degree, students must have been admitted to the EEB graduate program through the regular Tulane University admissions process. Students admitted to the program must have completed the requirements for a baccalaureate degree in any discipline that includes course work in Chemistry (General Chemistry, and either Organic Chemistry or Biochemistry) and Biology (Genetics, Ecology, and Evolution). Additional coursework may be required to make up deficiencies. Students will meet with the graduate advisor prior to the beginning of his/her first semester to discuss appropriate course work for this degree.

A maximum of 6 credits at the graduate level may be transferred to this degree program, at the discretion of the Chair of the Department. 4+1 Degree Program A Five-Year Combined Degree Program - B.S. in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology (EEBI) or Environmental Biology (ENVB) and M.S. in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology Description The five-year, combined degree program is open only to Tulane undergraduate students. It combines the Bachelor of Science degrees offered by the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology (EEB) with the terminal Master of Science degree in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, condensing what would normally be about six years of study into five years. Students pursuing the interdisciplinary bachelor's degree in Environmental Science may also apply. Undergraduate students typically graduate after four years of study, having fulfilled all regular requirements for the Bachelor of Science degree. The accelerated master's degree component allows six graduate credits (two 6000- or 7000- level courses) completed during the senior year to be applied to the B.S. degree as well as to the M.S. degree 1 . Each student pursuing the M.S. degree in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology then completes course work toward the master's degree during one additional year of graduate study. During the fifth (graduate) year the student typically completes a minimum of 24 credits of graduate work for a minimum total of 30 semester hours. The master's degree requires two semesters of independent study or internship courses instead of a written master's thesis. Each master's student will have a graduate advisor who has agreed to advise the student regarding the graduate program and to mentor the student during the independent study or internship. Rationale This degree program provides a broad background in the theories and methods of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at the graduate level, and comprises a minimum of 30 graduate credit hours. The purpose of the 4+1 master’s degree program is to provide students with training at the graduate level for one additional year beyond the baccalaureate degree. Thus, the master’s degree component provides more complete preparation for future career paths than the Bachelor of Science degree alone. Students electing to pursue this degree program typically desire a broad background rather than a degree program involving a specialization in a particular area based on a master’s thesis. Students who are interested in seeking employment with environmental agencies of federal, state, and municipal government; non-governmental organizations; and in private industry, including environmental consulting firms, will want to take advantage of the elective courses (listed below) that can be taken outside the Department in credit toward this degree. This degree program also will be useful to students planning to enter the field of environmental law as the elective courses outside the Department include law courses in that field. The degree program provides a foundation in Ecology and Organismal Biology. It requires independent study in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology (EBIO 6910, 6920) or Environmental Biology (EBIO 7150, 7160), or an internship with an approved off-campus agency (EBIO 7660, 7670). These components distinguish this terminal degree program from the thesis-based master's degree in EEB. The opportunity to undertake independent study or to accrue on-the-job training with a governmental or private agency through an internship lends a unique character to this program and may give graduates an employment advantage. Eligibility Applications and admissions for the 4+1 programs are rolling - applications are encouraged at any time of the year. Tulane undergraduate students are encouraged to talk with faculty about the 4+1 program during their junior year and may begin to take graduate level classes during their senior year, but should only apply formally during their senior year. By the end of the junior year (or at the time of application), candidates should have completed all LAS proficiency and distribution requirements for the B.S. degree and all core requirements for the major. Candidates are required to have a minimum 3.0 cumulative GPA and EEB GPA. To advance to the fifth (graduate) year, candidates must complete all requirements for the B.S. degree in EEB by the end of their senior year, while maintaining the minimum 3.0 cumulative and EEB GPAs. Teaching assistantships are not available to students pursuing this master's degree program. Footnote 1. During the senior year, two 6000- or 7000-level courses (6 credits), chosen in consultation with the graduate faculty advisor, may be completed toward both the bachelor's degree and the M.S. degree in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology. In some cases, students wishing to advance their work on the graduate component so as to devote more time to independent study or internship courses in the fifth year may petition the EEB Department to count as many as 12 credits of 6000- or 7000-level courses toward the graduate component. The six additional dual credits must be completed in excess of the 120 required for the bachelor's degree , giving the student a total of 126 credits or greater upon receiving the bachelor's degree.\n",

      "Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, PhD Overview Requirements The Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology (EEB) offers a Doctor of Philosophy degree. The curriculum is designed to encourage maximum student choice and independence while maintaining a close student-advisor relationship. Students are encouraged to adopt a broad, integrative view of science and biological research. Course offerings cover such areas as animal and plant physiology, plant ecology, plant-animal interactions, population biology, structural and evolutionary biology, systematic biology, environmental toxicology, marine/estuarine ecology, and the biology of diverse groups of plants and animals. Students participate in an active departmental seminar program and informal research discussion groups. Students accepted into the doctoral program are informally examined in Genetics, General Ecology, and Evolutionary Biology upon entry; based upon the results of that examination, the department makes recommendations as to the student's future course of study. By the end of the second year all formal course work is usually completed.The doctoral degree normally requires four or five years of study leading to the production of a publishable dissertation. In addition to university-wide requirements for the PhD, the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology has the following requirements for its PhD students.

Copies of this report must be submitted by January 25th to the student's thesis or dissertation advisor and to the departmental secretary for faculty review and placement in the student's departmental file. The Graduate Studies Committee and departmental faculty will review the annual reports to determine whether each student's progress has been satisfactory. Continued unsatisfactory progress is sufficient cause to revoke a teaching assistantship or terminate a student from the graduate program. Dissertation Research Following admission to candidacy, dissertation research hours are required (minimum of 3 hours per term, including summers) on a continuous basis until the dissertation committee certifies the student to graduate or until the department residency limit for PhD students is exhausted. Journal Submission All Ph.D. candidates must submit at least one chapter of dissertation for publication prior to final committee approval of the students dissertation defense.   A public defense of the presentation must be made in either a regular fall or spring term by the candidate prior to the final defense committee meeting.

      "Economics, PhD Overview Requirements Tulane University's Economics Department offers a Ph.D. program in Economics. This Ph.D. program gives students distinctive training designed to make them attractive candidates for employment in universities, government, multilateral organizations, the private sector, and the non-profit sector. Our program is distinguished by three features: Applied focus. The program is designed for students who are interested in using economic analysis to investigate real world problems. Students receive extensive training in the tools of economic analysis. These tools are an essential job skill for those who seek to evaluate public policies. Interdisciplinary approach. The program breaks down the barriers to interdisciplinary graduate education by incorporating field coursework and research experiences with our prestigious cross campus partners. Our cross campus partners include the Freeman School of Business, the Stone Center for Latin American Studies, the School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine, the Cowen Institute for Public Education Initiatives, the Department of Political Science, and the Murphy Institute of Political Economy. Students will acquire the practical interdisciplinary knowledge necessary for innovative research and careful policy analysis. Small, highly selective program with a high faculty-to-student ratio. This facilitates closer interaction between students and faculty, who are dedicated to research at the frontiers of their fields. Importantly, students have the opportunity to undertake joint research projects with faculty, as part of the training. Generous fellowships are available and are awarded on the basis of academic merit and potential for scholarship. Accepted students receive funding for five years, conditional on satisfactory progress through the program. Curriculum The degree of Ph.D. in economics requires 48 credit hours, passage of preliminary examinations within the first two years of study, a dissertation prospectus, a dissertation proposal, and a final dissertation defense. The course of study in the first year includes: microeconomics (two semesters) econometrics (two semesters) macroeconomics (one semester) applied econometric methods for policy analysis (one semester) In their second and third years, students will complete field courses in economics and in partner schools. Interdisciplinary fields of study have been designed so that students can draw from the expertise of faculty in Economics as well as our partner schools. The fields of concentration are: Health, education, and human capital Public economics and public policy Development, inequality, and poverty. While student research may ultimately focus on a single field of concentration, students will take classes spanning multiple concentrations and will be encouraged to explore synergies between multiple areas. Student Milestones, Required Examinations, and Monitoring of Progress to Degree There are six program milestones: (1) Preliminary Examination, (2) Field Paper, (3) Choosing a Dissertation Advisor and Committee, (4) the Dissertation Prospectus Defense (Admission to Candidacy), (5) the Dissertation Proposal Defense, and (6) the final Dissertation Defense itself. Satisfactory performance in the Ph.D. program is defined as maintaining at least a B average, obtaining no grade lower than a B-, and meeting these six milestones on time. The Preliminary Examination : is taken during the summer of the first program year. Failing the micro theory and/or econometrics portion(s) of the exam entitles a student to retake the failed portion in January of year II. Failing a second time is cause for dismissal. Students who fail a second time and are otherwise in good standing are typically allowed to continue in the program through the fourth semester. Satisfactory performance in 36 credit hours of approved graduate courses allows them to earn the degree of M.S. in Economics. Field Paper : In year II, students should choose a Field Paper Chair and, together with this Chair, form a Field Paper Committee. The Committee must have at least three faculty members on it, including the Chair. The Chair and at least one other Committee member must be tenured or tenure-track professors of Tulane University's Department of Economics. The third Committee member must be a tenured or tenure-track faculty member of Tulane University, from Economics or another discipline. Additional members from Tulane or other academic institutions may be added at the Chair's discretion. The student is to have a Field Paper proposal approved by the Committee by May 15 of program year II. The Field Paper is then written during the second summer. A full draft of the paper is to be handed in to the Chair by August 15, and a final version of the paper is due to the full Committee for approval by September 15. Dissertation Committee : The Field Paper Chair and Committee structure often evolve naturally into Dissertation Advisor and Dissertation Committee. However, this two-step structure also provides a natural opportunity to modify or entirely change the supervision of a student. It is expected that the Dissertation Committee will be formally constituted by December 15 of program year III. While there is no formal paperwork concerning this step, it is expected that the student will notify the Director of Graduate Studies via email, with copies to his Dissertation Committee members and to the Chair of the Department of Economics. 3 rd Year Prospectus Defense : With the Field Paper approved, the remainder of the Fall III semester is spent coming up with dissertation topics and choosing a Dissertation Committee. In order to aid the process of research topic development, third-year students are required to take ECON-7980, “Research Methods,” a class in which ideas are developed and presented on a weekly basis. Spring III is spent refining a dissertation prospectus under consultation with the Dissertation Committee, with the goal of a formal 3 rd Year Dissertation Prospectus Defense by May 15 of year III. Successful 3 rd Year Prospectus defense and satisfactory completion of the requisite coursework advances the student to Ph.D. Candidate status. It is the student’s responsibility to (i) schedule the defense with her/his Committee, (ii) obtain signatures for and submit to the Dean the “Approval of Dissertation Prospectus” and “Admission to Candidacy” forms, and (iii) give one copy to the Director of Graduate Studies and one copy to the Office Manager. A link to the required forms appears below. 4 th Year Dissertation Proposal Defense : Economics dissertations typically consist of three research papers. Years IV and V are entirely devoted to writing the dissertation. Students will be going on the job market in the fall of year V and job applications typically require submitting at least one fully polished dissertation paper to prospective employers by mid-October. With this objective in mind, the 4th Year Dissertation Proposal Defense should take place no later than May 15 of program year IV. The 4 th Year Proposal must consist of at least one fully developed paper and well-developed drafts of the rest of the dissertation. A successful 4 th Year Dissertation Proposal Defense implies certification by the Dissertation Committee that (a) a fully polished paper will be ready by the October job market deadline and (b) that it is feasible to complete the entire dissertation within the remaining Program year. Oral Defense: It is expected that the PhD in Economics will be earned in five years. Once the dissertation has been completed, the School of Liberal Arts requires an Oral Defense of the dissertation. In order for the degree of PhD in Economics to be completed the student must organize an oral defense of her/his dissertation, have the Dissertation Committee members sign the Oral Defense Approval Form, turn in a copy of the completed Form to the Economics Department Director of Graduate Studies, and submit the original signed form to the SLA Graduate Programs office immediately following the Defense.  Students are responsible for knowing the SLA deadlines for degree application and also knowing the requirements for format, paper type, number of copies to be submitted, and so on. These guidelines can be found under the heading “Directions for Completion of Graduation Requirements and Submission of Doctoral Dissertation” at this website: https://liberalarts.tulane.edu/academics/graduate-studies/graduating-students . A NOTE ON RESIDENCE REQUIREMENTS : Students should expect to complete the PhD program in five years and yet they will typically finish taking classes in the first half of that time.  The dissertation-writing phase thus accounts for at least half of the program. This is a very important, formative time when students mature as professional economists. They interact with the faculty, learn to teach and perform research by working with faculty members as RA’s or TA’s, present their own work in workshops and seminars, travel to conferences, participate in departmental seminars, and meet with visiting speakers. Students who choose to leave during this period typically never complete the PhD degree. It is therefore expected that all PhD students will remain in residence in New Orleans during this very important and formative period. Leaving New Orleans without obtaining explicit written approval from the student’s dissertation advisor and from the Director of Graduate Studies will constitute grounds for terminating financial support permanently. Any such written approval must be obtained by the end of the first month of the semester before the intended absence.\n",

      "English Major Overview Requirements The English Major at Tulane University offers a rich curriculum in which students learn to read, write, and think creatively and critically. In addition to coursework in diverse literatures, the English Department offers classes in such areas as film, television, graphic novels, hip hop, standup comedy, new media, environmental studies, queer studies, cultural studies, gender studies, critical race studies, postcolonialism, digital humanities, archival research, philosophy,  creative writing, and theory. Our majors receive extensive training in writing, speaking, and critical thinking throughout the curriculum and become adept at close reading, argumentation, complex and inventive thinking, interpretation, analysis, and research. The courses we offer also invite students to approach their world with a sense of empathy, civic engagement, inclusion, and justice, both through reading literature and through service-learning experiences that allow students to collaborate with local community members, such as those in schools and prisons. The course of study for the Major provides our students with experience in textual analysis, substantial instruction in writing, an understanding of literature and literary history in relation to systems of power, and the freedom to tailor coursework according to individual interests. As an English major, you can aim for breadth of study, taking courses in a variety of fields, or you can aim for depth of study, taking a number of courses within a particular field. Students may also opt for a Creative Writing Concentration by taking at least 4 creative writing courses among their electives. Required The course of study for the Major provides students with training in literary analysis and critical thinking, substantial instruction in writing, an understanding of literature and literary history in relation to systems of power, and the freedom to tailor coursework according to individual interests. Majors complete a minimum of 10 courses, which must include: THE GATEWAY COURSE ( ENLS 2000 Literary Investigations ): This course introduces majors to the discipline of literary studies, with an emphasis on close reading and analysis, theoretical approaches, research, and writing. 1 SURVEY COURSE ( ENLS 2010 Intro To British Literature I , ENLS 2020 Intro To British Literature II , ENLS 2030 Intro To American Literature , or ENLS 2040 Intro To Anglophone Literature): Our survey courses provide our majors with some understanding of literary and cultural history. By covering hundreds of years of literature, the courses make larger movements and shifts visible and provide a crucial context for understanding content in 4000- and 5000-level courses. 1 CAPSTONE SEMINAR ( ENLS 5010 Capstone Seminars ): Usually taken during the senior year, capstones are seminar-style courses (small class size; discussion-driven) that focus on a specialized field of study and culminate in a substantial research paper. Students who complete an English honors thesis do not need to take the Capstone, though they are welcome to do so for elective credit toward the Major. The Capstone also satisfies the SLA/Newcomb-Tulane Writing Intensive requirement. 7 ELECTIVES: In consultation with their major advisors, majors use electives to design their own course of study. Some majors opt for breadth, taking a variety of courses; others aim for depth, focusing on writing or a particular field of literature. There are some guidelines—see below for information about course level and distribution requirements. Students may also use electives to earn a Creative Writing Concentration . 3 of these electives must be 4000-level courses 1 elective may be at the 2000 level Students may take more than one Capstone Seminar, in which case the additional Capstone would count as an elective (and can substitute for one of the 3 required 4000-level courses) Students may complete an Internship (approved by the Department) for elective credit. (An internship does not substitute for one of the 3 required 4000-level courses.) DISTRIBUTION REQUIREMENTS: Majors must take at least one course in each of the following three areas that are central to literary study. Because these three areas have some fundamental inseparability, one course may satisfy up to two distribution requirements. These distribution requirements may be satisfied by a survey, an elective, or a capstone. Literature before 1800 American or Anglophone literature (i.e., not British) Non-dominant perspectives / non-canonical literature with an emphasis on race (including intersectional approaches to gender, sexuality, class, or disability) and on the analysis and critique of unequal systems of power (look here for information about approved courses) Course List Course ID Title Credits Gateway Course ENLS 2000 Literary Investigations 3 Survey Course Select one of the following: 3 ENLS 2010 Intro To British Literature I ENLS 2020 Intro To British Literature II ENLS 2030 Intro To American Literature ENLS 2040 Introduction to Anglophone Literature Electives Select three upper division electives (any ENLS courses at the 4000 level or higher) 9 Select three additional upper division electives (any ENLS courses at the 3000 level or higher) 9 Select one additional elective (any ENLS course at the 2000 level or higher) 3 Capstone Seminar ENLS 5010 Capstone Seminars 1 4 Total Credit Hours 31 1 Typically taken in the senior year Distribution requirements that can be satisfied by surveys, electives, or capstone: 1 course in literature before 1800 (British or American literature) 1 course in American or Anglophone literature (i.e., not British) 1 course in non-dominant perspective with an emphasis on race.\n",

      "English, MA Overview Requirements M.A. Programs Introduction The Department of English offers two Master’s degree programs: a two-year 4+1 M.A. program for Tulane undergraduate English majors, and a three-semester external M.A. program for English or Literature majors with B.A. degrees from Tulane or from other institutions. Each has its own admission requirements and its own timetable to completion. Students who have earned M.A. degrees in our programs have gone on to doctoral programs and law schools. They have embarked on careers as journalists as well as editors at magazines and publishing houses. Several of our graduates now teach in public and private secondary schools. We have graduates who work on staff as museum curators and in rare book libraries. But some of our graduates go on to careers not directly related to the degree. They chose to pursue the M.A. in order to challenge themselves, to continue the study of literature they enjoy, and to acquire a credential that adds value to their employment profile. 4+1 M.A. Program The 4+1 M.A. program in English serves Tulane English majors who are interested in pursuing careers or further education in literary studies, museum studies, library science, secondary teaching, and publishing, to name a few of the areas to which our students gravitate. The program begins in the student's senior year and continues for one additional year (the \"+1\" year) towards completion of the M.A. degree. During the \"+1\" year, tuition is approximately one-third the cost of regular undergraduate tuition, not including fees. Regular tuition applies to the senior year. More information on \"+1\" year tuition is available on the School of Liberal Arts' Applying to an SLA Graduate Program page. Undergraduate scholarships do not transfer to the \"+1\" year. How to Apply to the 4+1 Program Applications are made online at https://applygrad.tulane.edu/apply . Consult the English Department website's graduate program pages for the application deadline.

The external M.A. Program has the same curricular requirements and opportunities as the 4+1 program. We accept up to four courses of graduate work completed at other universities for transfer credit toward the M.A. degree. Although the program is designed to be completed in three semesters, students are permitted to complete it in four semesters. The tuition for the program is approximately one-third of undergraduate tuition, not including fees. More information on tuition is available on the School of Liberal Arts' Applying to an SLA Graduate Program page. How to Apply to the External M.A. Program Applications are submitted online through Tulane's School of Liberal Arts at its Graduate Admissions Application Portal page.

      "French Studies, MA Overview Requirements In New Orleans and Louisiana, French is a living language. In no other state in the Union – in no other city – is French culture so integrally built into the social fabric and its heritage still so vitally in play. The strong appeal of our program both nationally and internationally demonstrates that place matters: students who choose Tulane understand the compelling logic of pursuing their passion in a city so thoroughly steeped in its Francophone past. Located in what is often referred to as “the northernmost city of the Caribbean,” Tulane is at the crossroads of the two Americas and the larger Atlantic world, and in proximity to Haiti and the French Antilles. With the cultural history of French in our city and region, a living tradition of Francophonie , and the presence and activities of the French Consul General, our city is an ideal place for French study. The Department of French and Italian offers a 4+1 M.A. in French for Tulane undergraduate students. As a student in Tulane’s 4+1 M.A. in French, you will be part of the recovery and rediscovery of New Orleans’s French-speaking world. You will be contributing to the preservation of the cultural memory of French colonization and immigration from France, Canada, and the Caribbean, and of the city’s historic linguistic and ethnic diversity. The 4+1 M.A. in French is designed to establish a comprehensive knowledge of French and Francophone literature as well as an acquaintance with linguistics, literary theory, and the techniques of literary scholarship. Only current Tulane undergraduate students may apply to the 4+1 M.A. in French.  The Department does not offer a terminal M.A. in French for non-Tulane undergraduates. The 4+1 M.A. in French may also be combined with a DIPLÔME DE FRANÇAIS PROFESSIONNEL awarded by the Paris Chamber of Commerce in the following fields: AFFAIRES RELATIONS INTERNATIONALES TOURISME – HÔTELLERIE – RESTAURATION Undergraduate Tulane Students who major in French are eligible to apply for the 4+1 M.A. in French, a 5-year combined B.A. and M.A. program in French, if they maintain a grade point average of at least 3.0. The 4+1 M.A. in French may be combined with a DIPLÔME DE FRANÇAIS PROFESSIONNEL awarded by the Paris Chamber of Commerce in the following fields: AFFAIRES RELATIONS INTERNATIONALES TOURISME – HÔTELLERIE – RESTAURATION Students may apply to enter this program beginning in the Fall semester of their junior year, and applications will be accepted through the Fall semester of their senior year. Coursework Students in the 4+1 M.A. program will complete the normal undergraduate French major comprising 33 hours (15 hours of core courses and 18 hours of advanced courses). In their senior year (4th year), students will take 12 credits in French (four 6000-level classes or three 6000-level plus one 7000-level seminar). These 12 credits will then also be counted towards the 33 hours required for the 4+1 M.A. in French. BA Degree with Major in French 33 hours of course work 15 hours of core courses 18 hours of advanced courses, of which 12 will be taken during the senior year. (In exceptional cases, and depending on the rotation of course offerings, one or more courses taken in the junior year may be counted among these 12 hours.) Note: French majors doing the regular B.A. are not required to take 6000-level courses. 4+1 candidates will take 4 courses at the 6000 or 7000 level in their 4th year. 4+1 MA in French In their fifth year, students will take 4 courses in the Fall semester and 3 courses in the Spring semester. All course work should be taken within the Department of French and Italian. The M.A. Paper Students will write and defend an original research paper written under supervision of a faculty member and a second reader. It may be an expanded version of a course paper, and in its final form should be between 20 and 30 pages in length. At least one member of the M.A. committee must be a tenure-line faculty member. In the event that neither of the first two readers is a tenure-line faculty member, a third, tenure-line faculty member will be added to the committee. In all cases the first reader will be a faculty member whose institutional appointment includes the expectation of research. The revised paper is to be submitted to the first reader by March 1st. The defense must take place no later than the first week of April. The supervising professor and a second faculty reader will participate with the student in an oral defense of the paper. The defense will be open to the departmental faculty. Language Requirement Before the end of the Spring semester of their fifth year, all students in the 4+1 M.A. program will be expected to demonstrate reading competence in one of the following languages: Arabic, Creole (both taught within the department), Spanish, Italian, Latin, German, or medieval Occitan. The department will consider students’ petitions to have other languages accepted, but acceptance will depend upon the student making a case for the usefulness of this language to his or her research. Diplômes de Français Professionnel If a 4+1 MA in French will open the door to increased career prospects, a Diplôme de français professionnel will give you the accreditation necessary to make these prospects a reality. Recognized by companies and organizations worldwide and adapted to the modern business and cultural world, a Diplôme de français professionnel will enable you to demonstrate the level of competency required by your future employers. They will also allow you to connect with international and French-speaking professionals and will help you on your path to becoming a successful global citizen. Designed and offered by the Paris Ile-de-France Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the Diplômes de français professionnel are calibrated to coincide with the different levels of the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR) developed by the Council of Europe, with diplomas ranging from level elementary (A2) to proficient (C2). Candidates obtain a diploma upon completion of an exam, which is conceived based on real-life professional situations and is adapted to today’s economy. To prepare for the exam, students will be offered, depending on interest expressed, study skill workshops or individual sessions. They will also be given practice exams to take. In order for the department to gauge student interest in each particular diplôme , please declare your interest early during the semester by sending an email to Professor Sojic: asojic@tulane.edu . Filing for the Degree Students must inform the School of Liberal Arts of their desire to participate in graduate ceremonies. The Graduate Director will be asked to confirm, by audit, that candidates have completed their degree requirements. Students must also complete a departmental form available from the Graduate Director, called the 4+1 M.A. Checklist (see Graduate Handbook appendix).

      "French Studies, PhD Overview Requirements From Old French to Louisiana Creole, from codex to hypertext, graduate study at Tulane fosters a comprehensive and integrative approach to French Studies. With an international faculty covering a broad range of research and teaching interests, our program allows students to choose from a rich array of courses and encourages them to approach the study of language, literature and civilization through transhistorical and cross-cultural perspectives. This kind of comparative engagement provides students with intellectual depth and interdisciplinary dynamism. Students at Tulane have unique opportunities for exploring the French, Creole, and Cajun cultures of Louisiana. Our location affords us a privileged vantage point from which to observe other situations of localized or marginalized languages and cultures in their relationship to broader, often hegemonic forces: France’s regional languages (Occitan, Breton, Alsatian, etc.) in conflict with the official language revered as an inviolable symbol of national unity; immigrant cultural practices (such as the wearing of the veil) in conflict with French cultural norms; creole languages stigmatized as corrupt forms of the standard, etc. In our various fields of research, a focus on the local provides both a revealing lens through which to view the global and a healthy check on universalizing theories of culture and language. The program’s areas of strength include Francophone, Afro-Caribbean, and Mediterranean studies, medieval and early modern studies, cultural studies and cultural history, critical theory, political theory, gender studies, film theory, creole linguistics, European and African philosophy, performance studies and poetics. Financial support includes full tuition remission and a stipend for up to five years of Ph.D. study (four years for students entering with the M.A. degree). The stipend is approximately $26,000. To apply, please go to: https://applygrad.tulane.edu/apply/ The Ph.D. builds on a solid core of course work in French Studies and includes as well a concentration in an interdisciplinary subfield that may be fulfilled entirely or in part through courses taken in other departments or programs. The degree is interdisciplinary and integrative, drawing on diverse fields for a broad methodological base. Coursework Students must complete a minimum of 54 credit hours, including transfer work and work already presented for the M.A. degree. For students entering with a B.A., it is expected that course work will be completed by the beginning of the third year of study. Students will graduate with a Ph.D. in French Studies and a concentration in one of five integrated areas: Visual cultures and technologies – Courses in film, urbanism, new media, performance European studies – Courses in human rights; political, cultural and institutional histories; Islam in Europe; medical anthropology; and ethno-psychiatry Francophone colonial and post-colonial studies – Courses in Atlantic, Caribbean and African area studies; Creole(s) and creolization; Arabic and Islamic studies Language and identity – Courses in theory, philosophy, ethics and law, minority languages and identities, world languages and literatures Linguistics – Courses to include Survey of French Linguistics (FREN 6070), History of the French Language (FREN 6210), Field Research on French in Louisiana (FREN 6110), Special Problems in French Linguistics (FREN 6910), Translation Theory and Practice (FREN 6160), and courses in the Linguistics program (any course with an LING prefix). Students entering the program with the M.A. should declare their concentration at the end of their second semester on campus. B.A. students who will be continuing on to the Ph.D. should inform the Graduate Director of their choice of concentration when completing the M.A degree. Concentration in one of the four subfields will be constituted by successful completion of two graduate courses on topics related to the subfield. Students are also expected to demonstrate knowledge of their chosen field of concentration in the Ph.D. qualifying exams. One or both of the required courses may be taken in correlate departments or programs. Each semester, students at the Ph.D. level are allowed to take at most one course outside the Department of French and Italian. French 6050 (“Teaching French”) and French 6150 (“Critical Theory”) are required of all students and must be taken in the first semester that they are offered after the student enters the program. Beyond the 3 credits of 7000-level courses required for the M.A., doctoral candidates who begin the program with a B.A. must complete two additional 7000-level courses (that is, 6 credits of seminar-level courses). Students entering the program with an M.A. from another institution must complete two 7000-level courses in the Tulane program. During the course of their graduate study, Ph.D. students cannot take more than 3 hours (1 course) in independent study. Independent studies courses are approved only in exceptional cases; students are encouraged to fulfill their course requirements through regularly scheduled courses. Ph.D. Qualifying Exams For students entering the program with a B.A., two of three written Ph.D. preliminary exams will be taken in the Spring semester of the student’s third year, no later than two weeks before the end of classes. The specific date will be determined on an annual basis by the Graduate Advisor. The third, self-designed, exam will be taken in the second full week of classes of the Fall semester of the student’s fourth year. Students entering the program with an M.A. will take their first two exams in the Spring semester of their second year, no later than two weeks before the end of classes. The specific date will be determined on an annual basis by the Graduate Advisor. These students will take the third, self-designed, exam in the second full week of classes of the Fall semester of their third year. In the first week of the Fall semester prior to the semester in which the student plans to take the first two exams, they must notify the Director of Graduate Studies. The Director of Graduate Studies will then contact the student’s prospective dissertation advisor, who will serve as head of the examining committee and will select two additional readers. Students will sit for three written examinations and an oral examination. The oral examination will normally take place in the week following the first two written exams. All three written exams are take-home and open-book. The questions for the written exams normally will be made available to the student on a Friday morning at 9:00 a.m., and the answers must be submitted electronically to the examining committee by 5:00 p.m. of the following Monday. It is expected that the answers be both synthetic and analytical, and that they demonstrate familiarity with the primary and secondary texts on the reading list independently of recourse to lengthy quotation and paraphrase. All sources consulted must be duly cited. For each written exam, the student will answer either one or two questions. Students will normally write from 3500 to 4200 words (i.e., 10 to 12 pages in 12-point Times New Roman font with one-inch page margins) for each exam. If an exam consists of two separate questions, the 10 to 12 pages should be divided more or less evenly between them. The first written examination will cover a particular century. The second written examination will cover either a century or one of the four sub-fields listed above. The third, self-designed, written examination will be based on a reading list composed by the student in close consultation with their prospective dissertation director. The reading list for the self-designed exam should not significantly overlap with the reading list for either of the other two written exams and should be considered a blueprint for the dissertation bibliography. The oral examination will last for approximately one hour, the first twenty minutes of which will consist of the student’s analysis of a literary text. The analysis should not be read but presented extemporaneously from a copy of the primary text along with an outline or notes prepared ahead of time by the student. The remainder of the oral exam will cover the same material that was initially tested on the two written exams. The passage for textual analysis is chosen by the committee head in a conversation with the student in the semester prior to the examination semester. The student will not know ahead of time the precise work from which the text for analysis will be drawn, but will be provided with the text immediately upon his or her completion of the written exams. For all preliminary exams, the language of examination will be alternately French and English. The first exam will be written in one of those two languages and the second exam will be written in the other. The self-designed exam is to be written in the same language as the dissertation. The opening portion of the oral exam (the textual analysis and subsequent questions or comments pertaining to the analysis) will be presented in French. The remaining portion of the oral exam will be conducted primarily in French, but examiners may also ask questions in English, particularly when the reading material being tested is in English. When students announce their intention to sit for the Ph.D. exams, they should remember to inform the Director of Graduate Studies of their choice of language for each of the written exams. All examinations will be evaluated on a Pass/Fail basis, and a failed exam may be re-taken only once, normally within two to three weeks of the original exam. Students must pass all four exams, written and oral, in order to be admitted to candidacy. They will be informed of the result of the oral examination immediately following that exam, and they will learn of the committee’s decision regarding the first two written exams, including any need for re-takes, only after all sections of the exam (both oral and written) have been completed. Once the student has passed the self-designed exam, s/he will meet with the members of the examining committee to discuss the answer(s) to the exam and obtain guidance for writing the prospectus. Defense of the dissertation prospectus The dissertation prospectus should be defended by December 15 of the semester in which the student sits for the self-designed exam. The prospectus is approximately 10 to 15 pages in length, including a supporting bibliography that convincingly lays the ground for subsequent dissertation research. The student should be familiar with the works listed in the bibliography and be able to explain their relevance to the research project. After summarizing the prospectus, the student will answer questions from the faculty. The prospectus is to be approved by the dissertation director (first reader) and by two other professors serving as second and third readers. All committee members and all full-time faculty of the Department of French and Italian are invited to attend the prospectus defense, which is to be held during the academic year, but not during semester finals or between semesters. The prospectus must be submitted to readers no less than two weeks before the date of the defense, with a copy left in the conference room for other faculty to read. Upon successful defense of the prospectus, the student should ask readers to sign the form provided by the School of Liberal Arts ( http://tulane.edu/liberalarts/upload/prospectusform1.pdf ) . Reading knowledge examinations Students must demonstrate by examination reading competence in a second foreign language (beyond the language presented for the Master's) that is pertinent to their field of study. Students normally choose from among Arabic, Creole, Spanish, Italian, Latin, German, and medieval Occitan, but they may petition to have another language accepted if they can clearly demonstrate that it will be of significant use in their research. Language competence may be demonstrated by passing an examination administered by the department at Tulane in which the language is taught by standardized (ETS) examination, by official record of competence demonstrated elsewhere at the graduate level, or by satisfactory performance in a 6000- or 7000-level course taught in the language. In the summer, the Graduate School may offer reading-competence courses in languages for which there is adequate demand. Satisfactory performance on an exam given at the end of the course fulfills the reading-competence requirement for the degree. However, students may, if they wish, opt to take one of the external exams (as listed in the paragraph above) rather than sit for the in-course examination. As an alternative to demonstrating competence in this second foreign language (actually a fourth language, beyond French, English, and a third language for the M.A.), students may elect to do advanced coursework in the same language in which they demonstrated competence for the M.A. Successful completion of a graduate course requiring reading, speaking, writing, and lectures in that language will be accepted by the department in lieu of an examination in an additional language. Students who wish to conduct research in the early periods, as well as those who wish to pursue topics in other fields requiring special linguistic competence, are strongly urged to consult with faculty members in the relevant fields so that they may plan which languages to study. Defense of the dissertation The oral defense of the dissertation, held after the dissertation has been approved by all three committee members (or, if necessary, by two out of the three), will be open to all members of the committee and to all full- time faculty of the Department of French and Italian.\n",

      "General Law, LLM Overview Requirements The General LLM program allows students to design their own courses of study. General LLM students may enroll in virtually any course, with the general exception of clinical programs and Trial Advocacy. Some students pursue a broad range of courses, and others focus their choices more narrowly. Many international students use the General LLM program as a way to gain exposure to a variety of areas of US law. They may choose to enroll in a combination of introductory and more advanced courses in a variety of areas. Because the typical first-year courses are open to our graduate students, some choose to take such courses as Torts, Contracts, Criminal Law, Constitutional Law, and Property. Students find that the General LLM program lends itself to the development of ad hoc concentrations. For example: Students interested in intellectual property might take Intellectual Property, Copyright & Trademarks, Patent Law, one or more specialized courses in the area, a Directed Research project supervised by a faculty member who is an expert in the area, and even one or two unrelated courses. Students interested in international trade might take such courses as: International Trade, Finance & Banking; Financial Institutions; International Tax; International Business Transactions; and a variety of related courses. Students may even find it possible to concentrate in two areas through the General LLM program. Because the General LLM program has no distribution requirements, students are free to make independent choices about the courses in which they enroll.\n",

      "General Legal Studies, B.A. Overview Requirements The School of Professional Advancement's General Legal Studies Program was first approved by the American Bar Association’s (ABA) Standing Committee on Paralegals in 1981 and earned its most recent reapproval in 2023.  Throughout this time, the program has maintained compliance with the rigorous ABA guidelines that govern all aspects of our operations, providing our graduates with the  superior education that ABA requires and legal employers demand. The General Legal Studies Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree and accompanying Paralegal Certificate, awarded simultaneously, require 120 credits for completion, including 36 credits in the GLSP major. Carefully sequenced coursework begins with core skills classes that emphasize legal research, writing, and analysis, along with law office technology, legal ethics, and other practical aspects of the legal profession. In ensuing semesters, upper-level electives allow students to explore major areas of substantive law. In or near the final semester, students not already employed as paralegals take the practicum course, which includes a 100-hour internship in a legal services office and an instructional component focusing upon legal ethics, professionalism, and career success skills.  Students already employed as paralegals may apply to waive GLSP 5900 Gen Legal Studies Practicum (3 c.h.) – and replace the course with an additional GLSP 4000-level elective. GLSP courses are offered in person or online, in either synchronous remote (meeting one evening per week on Zoom) or fully online ( with at least two Zoom sessions that are recorded for those who cannot attend) formats .  Subject to the ABA requirement that each student must complete at least 3 classes (9 credits) in person or in synchronous remote format, you may take your GLSP classes from wherever you may be , in the format that suits your needs and preferences . Many of our graduates pursue careers as paralegals or in other positions in law firms, courts, corporations, government agencies, non-profit legal service providers, and other legal services offices, while others enter law school and become attorneys. General Legal Studies Program Mission Statement : The General Legal Studies Program provides our students with the skills, wisdom, and integrity to create, communicate and conserve knowledge and to pursue careers as efficient, ethical legal professionals who are prepared to assist attorneys in courts, governmental agencies, law firms, and other legal services offices, or to apply to law school after graduation, if they choose. General Legal Studies Program Learning Outcomes On completion of the General Legal Studies Program curriculum, graduates will have the knowledge and skills to: Describe and analyze the differences among the jurisdictions and functions of the state and federal civil, criminal, and administrative court systems. Interpret and apply legal terminology. Describe the primary differences between the Louisiana Civil Law legal system and the common law legal system. Perform legal research using both traditional and electronic methods and summarize findings in legal memoranda and briefs. Perform factual investigations using both traditional and electronic methods. Cite authorities consistent with the adopted legal citation manual ( The Bluebook: A Uniform System of Citation ). Draft memoranda of law and legal correspondence. Locate, identify, and apply state and federal court filing and e-filing requirements. Draft the documents required to initiate, file, and respond to a civil action. Draft discovery requests and responses and pre-trial motions. Use industry-standard law office technology to organize and manage documents, files, billing data, and dockets for trial and for other law practice management purposes. Identify and apply the rules and principles of legal ethics governing the paralegal profession. Note: Paralegals are trained professionals who work under the supervision of licensed attorneys. Paralegals are not lawyers and are not permitted to practice law or to provide legal services directly to the public, except as permitted by law. Credit Transfers toward the BA in General Legal Studies Tulane SoPA’s General Legal Studies Program does not accept the transfer of credits for paralegal or legal studies courses completed at paralegal or legal studies programs that were not approved by ABA’s Standing Committee on Paralegals at the time the courses were taken. Consistent with Tulane SoPA’s undergraduate credit transfer policy, which is found here: https://sopa.tulane.edu/admissions/student-transfers/undergraduate , students pursing the General Legal Studies BA and Paralegal Certificate may be permitted to transfer in up to 18 credits (50%) of the 36 legal studies/paralegal course credits required for the GLSP major, provided each course (1) meets all SoPA undergraduate course transfer requirements; (2) was completed at a paralegal or legal studies program that was approved by ABA’s Standing Committee on Paralegals at the time the class was completed; and (3) has been reviewed and approved by the General Legal Studies Program Director.

Following the successful defense of the prospectus, students are admitted to PhD candidacy and proceed with dissertation research. Dissertation Students must conduct original scholarly research and defend a dissertation based on that research. The dissertation research demonstrates scholarly work and is the basis for the dissertation. Many graduates of HPAM follow the three-paper model as this delivers publishable units closer to what is demanded by the types of jobs graduates of this program pursue.  The student must defend the dissertation in an oral exam.  This process must be completed within seven years of matriculation into the PhD program.

      "Historic Preservation, MS Overview Requirements The Masters of Science in Historic Preservation trains students to become leaders in the field of historic preservation and its allied disciplines. A comprehensive four-semester program provides students with the knowledge and skills to succeed in this dynamic and interdisciplinary field. The first two semesters provide training in the foundational elements of preservation practice in the 21 st century, including coursework in the history and theory of the discipline, regional and national architecture, preservation law, architectural conservation, and historic building investigation and documentation. Year two provides students with the opportunity to specialize in various areas of historic preservation including: digital technology, heritage resilience and sustainability, and architectural conservation. The program culminates in a thesis or practicum. Ultimately the program exposes students to the breadth of historic preservation in the US and International contexts. Using New Orleans as a laboratory, one that is linked to the wider Gulf Coast and Caribbean region, students are trained in an incomparable context for challenges that cross-cut historic preservation from issue in climate change, heritage justice, and housing affordability. In addition to the MS, students may apply to and concurrently complete master degrees in either Architecture (M.Arch) or Sustainable Real Estate Development (MSRED). Students can also specialize through the certificate program in Sustainable Real Estate Development (SRED).

      "History Major Overview Requirements The history major requires all students to take a minimum of 30 credits or ten courses (excluding one-credit courses). The major aims to assure that all students have taken at least one course in four areas of the world (United States, Europe, Latin America, Middle East, Asia and Africa). It also aims to assure some exposure by all students to history prior to 1800, when there is much less evidence for making historical judgments than in the modern era, as well as requiring at least one course from the modern era. Apart from these distribution requirements, students are free to pursue their interests in one or more areas of history in as much depth as they choose. All history majors are required to take three seminars. The aim of these seminars is to train students how to understand the contingency of historical interpretation to frame historical questions, to learn to use primary sources to find the evidence necessary to develop historical analysis, and to write papers in clear and coherent prose. All history majors must take two of the department's 6000-level Advanced Seminars. At least one of these Advanced Seminars must be taken during a student’s Junior or Senior year. All 6000-level seminars have, as one of their central requirements, a major research paper that incorporates analytical, research and writing skills.  Finally, students must take a third seminar at either the 3000 or the 6000 level. The department suggests, but does not require, that students take a 3000 level seminar before taking an Advanced Seminar. The History major consists of ten courses totaling at least 30 credits, excluding one-credit courses. All majors must take at least three seminars, including two Advanced Seminars at the 6000 level ( students who declared their majors prior to 2021 AND have completed a Methods Seminar need only take one Advanced Seminar ). The third seminar may be at the 3000 or 6000 level. Seminars must be taken at Tulane. At least one Advanced Seminar must be taken during a student’s junior or senior year. Students must take at least one pre-1800 course and at least one post-1800 course. Students must take at least one course in four of the following six areas: Africa (HISB), Asia (HISC), Europe (HISA and HISE), Latin America (HISL), Middle East (HISM), and United States (HISU). No more than three (3) 1000 level courses may count toward the major. Courses that do not have a letter grade cannot count toward the major. A maximum of two courses from other departments can count towards the major. Advanced Seminars Advanced seminars - numbered 6000 to 6999 -  are open to sophomores, juniors and seniors, and also to graduate students. Sophomores may require permission from the course instructor to enroll in a 6000-level seminar.

      "International and Comparative Law, LMI Overview Requirements The breadth and depth of the international and comparative law curriculum at Tulane Law School provide unparalleled opportunities for both US and foreign lawyers to receive a basic foundation in international legal practice. Tulane’s program offers courses in public international law, private international law including international business transactions, and comparative law. Tulane’s unique perspective in a historically mixed common law-civil law jurisdiction results in an unusually rich experience for students. Tulane offers its students a strong faculty with significant international experience and training, an outstanding library, and the resources of the Eason-Weinmann Center for Comparative Law, which brings together outstanding legal scholars from various countries and legal systems for seminars and lectures. Each student's course of study is at least somewhat dependent upon the background and previous legal education of the individual student and on the student's objectives. For example, US students interested in European legal studies would need exposure to European legal sources and European Community Law. A student from Germany, however, might focus her studies somewhat differently, seeking exposure to common law subjects and to other areas which she would be unlikely to have studied previously. Each student designs his or her course of study with the assistance of a faculty advisor. In addition to fulfilling the General Degree Requirements, all candidates for the LLM in International & Comparative Law are required to enroll in a total of 13 semester hours of international and comparative law courses. All students who have not already taken a public international law course are required to take Public International Law, with the remaining 10 hours of specialized coursework chosen from the following offerings: Civil Law Seminar Comparative Law: European Legal Systems European Union Law European Law of Obligations: French or German European Legal History Foreign Affairs and National Security Human Rights Discourse Immigration Law International Sale of Goods Transnational Litigation International Business Transactions International Commercial Arbitration International Criminal Law International Environmental Law International Human Rights International Income Tax International Intellectual Property International Trade, Finance and Banking Law of the Sea Maritime and National Security Law Products Liability & Mass Torts in Comparative Perspective Any one-credit mini-courses in international and comparative law\n",

      "Juris Doctor Overview Requirements Our Curriculum Tulane’s first-year program emphasizes developing core analytic and legal writing skills. Faculty teach required first-year courses in classes of approximately 75 students to encourage close participation in the give-and-take of Socratic discussion. Using the case method, students dissect judicial decisions, respond to professors’ and classmates’ questions and carefully consider competing arguments. First-year legal research and writing professors also teach small-section courses, in which students develop the writing strategies and skills to succeed in practice. After the first year, students are free to design their own curriculum from an array of electives. Tulane offers specialized courses in conjunction with our certificate programs, which approximately one-third of students complete. Many students also earn academic credit through in-depth training opportunities outside the classroom. Some choose to hone their writing and editing techniques by joining one of our eight legal journals. Others compete in trial and appellate moot court teams to train in oral and written advocacy. Students acquire real-world experience in our law clinics and labs. Our clinics, Trial Advocacy course and boot camp skills-training program teach the students key skills to succeed in their future practice. Areas of Study Tulane is proud to offer six distinctive programs in which students may earn a certificate of concentration: Civil Law, International and Comparative Law, Maritime Law, Environmental Law and Sports Law. Beyond the certificate programs, Tulane holds core courses in alternative dispute resolution; constitutional law; consumer law; corporate and commercial law; civil law and procedure; criminal law and procedure; energy law; legal ethics and professionalism; family law; health law; labor and employment law; property and real estate law; administrative and regulatory law; state and local government procedure; tax law; and advanced legal writing. Faculty in both specialty and traditional areas of study are nationally and internationally recognized for their contributions to their fields. Upper-level students have the freedom to choose from our broad range of course offerings and can select any combination of classes. Civil Law Program Tulane Law’s capacity to teach the world’s two preeminent legal systems is one of its greatest strengths. Students who intend to practice in common law jurisdictions will find the same extensive course offerings at Tulane as at other national law schools. However, Tulane offers students who plan to practice internationally or in civil law jurisdictions an assortment of civil law classes not offered at most law schools. Students may take either common or civil law courses, and many take a mix of both to expand their legal knowledge and practice potential. Candidates for the Juris Doctor degree must spend six full-time semesters in academic residence and complete 88 semester hours at the Law School with at least a 2.0 or C average. All candidates must successfully complete (i) the first-year curriculum, (ii) the Legal Profession course, (iii) the upper-class writing requirement, (iv) six credits of experiential learning, and (v) the 50-hour pro bono requirement.

Over the course of two semesters, students will learn the techniques of legal problem-solving, and learn to research and draft legal memoranda and briefs through a series of progressively more complex writing assignments. The course culminates with the drafting of an appellate brief and an oral argument before an appellate moot court. Upper-Class Curriculum After their first year, J.D. students are free to design their own curriculum from an array of electives, or to concentrate their studies in an area of curricular strength advanced courses in conjunction with our certificate programs. Optional summer programs and externship opportunities are offered in New Orleans and in a variety of locations throughout the world. Upper-Level Writing Requirement JD students must successfully complete one rigorous writing project after their first year of law school.

      "Labor and Employment, MJ Overview Requirements The Master of Jurisprudence (M.J.) is a post-baccalaureate degree that allows non-legal professionals to enhance career related skills through the study of the laws, governmental policy, and the legal system. This degree is designed to infuse career based knowledge with legal education. MJ-LEL students are chosen from among this nation’s incumbent and aspiring human resource professionals, as well as those in management and leadership roles who have personnel responsibilities. The Labor and Employment Law MJ program from Tulane is delivered in a hybrid format through which students complete most of their coursework online and only come to campus once for a multi-day Education Immersion Weekend. The program is ideally suited for accomplished, busy working professionals from companies across the nation. Human resource professionals ― whether they carry formal HR titles or are business managers with personnel responsibilities ― serve as the crucial link between an organization’s management and its employees. A formal, academic credential in Labor and Employment Law offers the knowledge needed to comply with the myriad regulations established by state and federal law and and teaches the skills required to successfully navigate everything from creating personnel manuals, to engaging in collective bargaining, to administering benefits, to handling sensitive employee relations issues. The program requires the completion of 30 credit hours, and typically takes two years to complete. This online, non-residential program was designed for human resource professionals and those seeking to transition into HR. Students will obtain additional expertise and familiarity with the extensive and complex body of federal and state regulations that govern most aspects of recruitment, hiring and retention of employees. The MJ-LEL program includes a one-time on-campus Education Immersion Weekend, in addition to its online course curriculum. Curriculum Semester 1 Students must take both of these required courses: Legal Analysis I (2 credits) Introduction to Employment Discrimination Law Principles and Strategies (3 credits) Semester 2 Students must take both of these required courses: Legal Analysis II (2 credits) Introduction to Labor Law Principles and Strategies (3 credits) Semester 3 Students must take both of these required courses: Employment Law (2 credits) IP Issues in the Employment Context (3 credits) Semester 4 Students must take this required course, plus one 2-credit elective: Sex and Gender Issues in the Workplace (3 credits) Semester 5 Students must take this required course, plus one 2-credit elective: Social Media Issues in the Workplace (3 credits) Semester 6 Students must take this required course, plus one 2-credit elective: Capstone (3 credits) Elective Courses Negotiating Skills (2 credits) Employee Medical Leaves of Absence (2 credits) Developing and Managing the Workforce: Recruitment, Retention, Termination, Retirement and Turnover (2 credits) Privacy in the Workplace (2 credits) Investigating, Mediating and Arbitrating Employee Complaints (2 credits) On-Site Education Immersion Weekend (EIW) All students enrolled in the online MJ program must attend one EIW to be eligible to receive the Masters degree. Students are welcome to attend more than the one EIW session. Each session is composed of two days of academic and other programming at the Law School during the summer. The EIW is designed to (a) supplement the online curriculum by involving students and faculty in discussion of new developments and unique other issues not addressed in the online curriculum; (2) provide students with networking opportunities by meeting their peers; (3) provide students and faculty opportunities to meet face-to-face; and (4) provide a tangible link between the students and the law school to promote their continued relationship to the school.

      "Latin American Studies and Art History, PhD Overview Requirements This joint program is small and highly selective. It will probably accept only one or two highly qualified applicants each year, based on recommendations, performance, and other indicators of academic excellence and the ability to conduct original, clearly articulated research that will advance the frontiers of knowledge. Prospective students should submit their application to this joint Ph.D. program here , where you can read relevant information on the application process and where you can find the link to the actual online application system in the “APPLY HERE” section of the page. Students are admitted to the program only after demonstrating an ability to work in a critical and imaginative fashion. Along with the School of Liberal Arts graduate program application form, applicants submit transcripts, three letters of recommendation, a statement of purpose, evidence of language ability, and an M.A. thesis or two substantive research papers. The Ph.D. requires 54 credit hours (including an M.A. thesis or equivalent) in addition to qualifying examinations in two concentration areas and the production of a dissertation. Of the 54 credit hours of coursework, at least 30 hours must have a Latin American content, including at least 18 hours in Latin American art; other Latin American courses can be taken in departments such as Anthropology, Economics, History, Political Science, Sociology, and Spanish and Portuguese; the School of Architecture; and Latin American Studies special offerings. Fifteen credit hours must be in art history pertaining to areas outside Latin America. The balance of credit hours are electives; they may be in art history and/or Latin America, but they may also pertain to other areas relevant to the student’s work (e.g., European history, Medieval thought, writing systems). The Latin American Studies core seminar is required, as is a course on art historical method and/or theory. All courses must be at the 6000 and 7000 levels. Students must develop a primary concentration (e.g., Pre-Columbian, colonial, or modern) and a secondary one. The second concentration may be within Latin American art (e.g., Pre-Columbian, colonial, or modern), or it may cover a comparative area (e.g., modern Latin American art paired with modern European art, or colonial Latin American art paired with medieval and early modern European art). Twenty-one semester hours (7 courses) must pertain to the primary concentration, and 12 semester hours (4 courses) must pertain to the secondary concentration. These courses may be in Art History or other disciplines with Latin American content. For example, a student with a primary concentration in Precolumbian and a secondary concentration in colonial would take 7 art history and anthropology courses with a Precolumbian content, and 4 courses with a colonial content in art history, history, or literature.\n",

      "Latin American Studies Major Overview Requirements Latin American Studies prepares students for a job market that increasingly demands keen global sensibilities and the ability to work between cultures. Introducing diverse methodological and theoretical approaches to the study of Latin America, while providing a core interdisciplinary foundation in the humanities and social sciences, Latin American Studies prepares students to engage a broad spectrum of local and global phenomena with intellectual rigor and flexibility. Students may choose courses from twenty cooperating departments, taught by some seventy affiliated faculty speci alizing in the region. Interdisciplinary and comparative perspectives on the region offer students a depth of knowledge of hemispheric relations and build area expertise . The curriculum approaches Latin America as both a local and foreign culture , illuminat ing critical transnational issues such as immigration, climate change, cultural flows, security, and economic development that transcend the boundaries of the region . The major’s solid foundation in language skills , cultural and political understanding , experiential learning and international education and training provide critical preparation for careers in an increasingly globalized world. Students receiving this degree go on to careers in business, education, public service, government and humanitarian work, health care and health sciences , and law and advocacy, among others. Many graduates pursue careers in education or go on for more advanced degrees in Latin American Studies and a range of disciplines in the humanities and social sciences including Sociology, Political Science, Anthropology, Art History, Communications, History and others . The major also provides a valuable supplement for those who subsequently purs ue professional degrees in business, law, engineering, medicine, public hea lth or other fields. Students majoring in Latin American Studies are urged to minor (or get a second major) in a core discipline such as anthropology, economics, history, literature, art history, political science, or sociology. The Latin American Studies major requires a minimum of 30 credit hours in 10 Latin American content courses. Courses are selected from the various departments offering classes in the field as well as from Latin American Studies. Latin American Studies students should consult the Schedule of Classes each semester to review available electives and are advised to confer with their major advisor to structure their course of study, particularly when planning study abroad coursework.

      "Latin American Studies, MA Overview Requirements The Roger Thayer Stone Center for Latin American Studies is one of the largest and most prestigious interdisciplinary units at Tulane University. It functions in many capacities to provide programming and degree plans to a broad range of educational constituencies. Currently, these include a Bachelor of Arts major and minor in Latin American Studies, a Master of Arts degree in Latin American Studies, and a Doctor of Philosophy degree in Latin American Studies. The design of the M.A. and curriculum in Latin American Studies is dependent upon the student’s particular research interests. While we welcome all qualified applicants interested in pursuing interdisciplinary research on Latin America, the STONE CENTER /TU has developed significant faculty strengths in \"Economics, Politics & Society in Latin America\" and \"Arts, Media, Culture & Politics in Latin America.\" The Stone Center also has very strong regional expertise in Brazilian Studies and Cuban & Caribbean Studies. The Graduate Advisor and the student will discuss the student's research interests before the start of the student’s first semester of coursework and will map out a comprehensive program of study with the goal of developing an interdisciplinary research project. Students accumulate the research skills and tools by undertaking coursework in multiple disciplines or fields. Students should expect to narrow their coursework to one primary and two secondary concentration areas. Of course, there is also the opportunity to extend one’s coursework beyond these three concentration areas when the research project will be enhanced by doing so. The Stone Center also collaborates with other units across the University to offer specialized graduate degree programs. Such programs include joint professional degree programs with the Law School (MA/JD) and the Business School (MA/MBA), and a dual Doctor of Philosophy degree (a Ph.D. in Latin American Studies and Art History). For further information on these specialized degree programs, please consult the relevant sections of our website . Distribution Requirements Degree requirements include 30 credit hours as follows: Course List Course ID Title Credits Select a primary concentration (History, Anthropology, etc.) 12 Select a second supporting concentration 6 Select a third supporting concentration 6 LAST 7000 Core Seminar 3 Select one of the following options: 3 Option One: The M.A. thesis, written under the direction of a thesis director and approved by a faculty committee. Option Two: A three-hour course in theory or methodology in the primary concentration. Total Credit Hours 30 Option One: The M.A. thesis, written under the direction of a thesis director and approved by a faculty committee. Students register for thesis credit in the fourth semester ( LAST 8990) and are required to participate in a thesis writing workshop under the direction of the Graduate Advisor. This is a graded course. A passing grade is assigned for the thesis by the Graduate Advisor if the student successfully defends the thesis by the end of the Spring semester. [NOTE: If a student plans to graduate in the Spring Semester of their second year of study, the thesis must be completed, defended, and submitted to the School of Liberal Arts in final form usually by the first week of May.] If the student has not completed and defended the thesis by the end of the Spring semester of the second year of studies, a grade of “I\" (Incomplete) will be reported until such time as the student completes the thesis AND applies to graduate. If the student fails to complete the thesis within one year of the end of the second year of study, the “I’‘ grade will convert to a failing grade. Option Two: A three-hour course in theory or methodology in the primary concentration. This need not be a Latin American content course. For example, in Sociology, the relevant courses are “Intermediate Social Statistics\" and “Intermediate Sociological Methods’‘; in Anthropology, “Field Methods in Social and Cultural Anthropology\"; and in Political Science, “The Conduct of Research’‘ and “Statistics for Political Scientists.’‘ Where a department does not have an appropriate offering, the Stone Center Graduate Advisor will help the student arrange an independent study project in the methodology of the primary concentration. This course must be taken by the end of the third semester. Concentrations The concentrations are usually departmental/disciplinary and are intended more as a guide to help organize a student's curriculum around a specific research project. Where a student's program suggests that there is an educational and qualitative logic, it is also possible to declare one synthetic concentration that combines courses from more than one department. Such a concentration might be, for example, “Cultural Studies\" or “Mexican Studies.’‘ Students are also encouraged, in consultation with the Graduate Advisor, to take courses that may fall outside of their concentration areas if such courses are critical to the development of specific research skills, tools, methods, or content necessary in the pursuit of their research agendas. Language Requirement The requirement for graduation with the M.A. in Latin American Studies is demonstrated competence in either Spanish or Portuguese. Students are expected to pass a language examination in Spanish or Portuguese during the first year of study. The required level of competence in Spanish and Portuguese corresponds to “intermediate-high’‘ on the American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Language ( ACTFL ) scale or the Avant STAMP 4S scale. This competency is considered a minimum requirement. Students are encouraged to develop additional languages as needed by their research fields. Currently, the Avant STAMP 4S examinations are administered by the Language Learning Center ( https://liberalarts.tulane.edu/language-learning-center/language-testing/proficiency ). Native Spanish and Portuguese speakers are exempt from this requirement, though they are still encouraged to take the examination. Transfer of Credit Upon entering the program a maximum of six graduate-level course credits (two courses) may be transferred from another department of Tulane or another University toward your Latin American Studies M.A. degree. However, students who do choose to transfer two courses will lose one semester of M.A. funding (limiting thesis writers to three semesters and non-thesis writers to two). To be considered for transfer credit toward an M.A. degree, graduate work done at another institution must carry a grade of 3.0 (on a 4.0 scale) or better and must have been completed no more than four years from the date of first registration for graduate work at Tulane. Acceptance of graduate credit for work done at other graduate institutions must be approved by the Stone Center for Latin American Studies and by the Dean of the School of Liberal Arts. Although the official decision concerning the acceptance of transfer credit towards the Latin American Studies M.A. degree will be made only after the student has completed one semester of successful study in the program, the Stone Center Graduate Advisor can evaluate the transferability of previous coursework before the student enters the program. If you are planning to transfer credit, remember to contact your Graduate Advisor after you have completed your first semester in the degree program so that he may recommend your credit for transfer. Independent Studies Independent Studies can be an important part of your program if used properly and sparingly. Typically an independent project is created to fill an academic need or interest that is not being met by regular disciplinary offerings or to expand upon research begun in other courses but not fully completed. Ordinarily, the Graduate Advisor will not authorize students to take more than two stand-alone Independent Study courses during the course of their M.A. degree. Students may register for the independent study directly through the Latin American Studies program; but students should first attempt to register for the independent study through the department of the sponsoring faculty member. Please consult the Graduate Advisor for further information on registering for independent study.\n",

For further information on these specialized degree programs, please consult the relevant sections of our website . The standard Tulane University graduate program online application system allows applicants to identify whether their application should be considered for admission either as an M.A. student or as a Ph.D. student. The admissions policy of the Stone Center, however, is to consider for admission directly to the Ph.D. program only individuals who have an earned Master’s Degree or relevant professional degree (i.e. M.D., J.D., etc.) Applicants interested in the Ph.D. Program in Latin American Studies, but who do not have an earned Master’s Degree or a relevant professional degree, will be considered for admission only to the M.A. program in Latin American Studies. Upon completion of the M.A. Program in Latin American Studies, such students are then able to reapply to the Ph.D. program. Admission to the M.A. program does not guarantee continuation in the Ph.D. program. Doctor of Philosophy in Latin American Studies Curriculum The degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Latin American Studies is awarded for mastery of a body of literature and for the production of imaginative and original research. A student may enter the program (1) progressing from the M.A. program in Latin American Studies at Tulane, (2) transferring to the program with an M.A. conferred by another Tulane department, (3) or by applying directly to the Latin American Studies Ph.D. program after having completed an M.A. in any discipline or field, or an equivalent Professional Degree (JD, MD, MBA, etc.). In each instance, prospective students must submit a formal application for admission to the Ph.D. program. Each semester doctoral students normally enroll in three classes and teach one class. By university regulations, students are allowed to enroll in a minimum of two courses while they serve as Teaching Assistants. Students also begin preparation for general preliminary examinations, which are given during students’ last semester of classes and should be taken no later than the first semester after the completion of all coursework requirements. These are normally in October or March. Upon satisfying the coursework and language requirements and completing the general exams, students begin research for the dissertation, presenting a formal prospectus for faculty approval. Once approved they can apply for admittance to candidacy for the doctoral degree and commence formal work on the dissertation, which must demonstrate their ability to carry out an original investigation in the field of Latin American Studies. Degrees are conferred only after the dissertation is approved in a formal defense before a faculty committee. Coursework and Distribution Requirements The minimum coursework requirement for the Ph.D. is 54 credit hours. Portions of this requirement are often satisfied by credit awarded for academic work completed in fulfilling requirements for the M.A. degree with thesis. Students with an M.A. in Latin American Studies from Tulane may transfer up to 30 credits of relevant work from their M.A. program, while students transferring from other departments at Tulane or other universities may transfer no more than 12 hours of relevant work (see Transfer Credit below). General requirements for the Ph.D. degree are: Thirty semester hours in the primary concentration, including a minimum of six semester hours in theory, methodology, and pedagogy. Students transferring to the Stone Center from other programs must take the Latin American Studies Core Seminar in their first Fall semester to satisfy three hours of the theory and methodology requirement. And all Ph.D. students must take the required Pedagogy and Professional Development course in the Spring semester before the academic year in which they are scheduled to teach the LAST 1010 course cycle for the first time. NOTE : Of the thirty semester hours in the primary concentration, twelve hours or four courses should be at the 7000 level when possible; and no more than nine hours or three courses should be stand-alone independent study. Twelve semester hours in a first supporting concentration; six of these hours, when possible, should be at the 7000 level. Twelve semester hours in a second supporting concentration; six of these hours, when possible, should be at the 7000 level. A demonstrated knowledge of at least two languages, including Spanish or Portuguese. The successful completion of three general preliminary examinations in the primary and supporting concentrations. The successful defense of a dissertation prospectus. The successful completion and defense of the dissertation. Concentrations The concentrations are usually departmental/disciplinary and are intended more as a guide to help organize a student’s curriculum around a specific research project. Where a student’s program suggests that there is an educational and qualitative logic, it is also possible to declare one synthetic concentration that combines courses from more than one department. Such a concentration might be, for example, Cultural Studies or Mexican Studies or Gender & Sexuality Studies, etc. Students are also encouraged, in consultation with the Graduate Advisor, to take courses that may fall outside of their concentration areas if such courses are critical to the development of specific research skills, tools, methods, or content necessary in the pursuit of their research agendas. Transfer Credits At the time of admission, the Graduate Advisor can provide an informal assessment about what previous course credit can be transferred to meet Ph.D. requirements, but University policy allows the Graduate Advisor to make a formal evaluation of requests for transfer credit only after students have completed nine hours in residence at Tulane. After that point, and before the student accumulates a total of 42 credit hours, the Graduate Advisor recommends the transfer of appropriate and germane credit to the Graduate Dean for approval. Students seeking transfer credits should be prepared to provide copies of syllabi and/or course term papers as evidence of the relevance of the courses in question to their graduate work in their Latin American Studies program. Only courses that have a theoretical or content-specific logic to a student’s Latin American Studies academic program will be approved for transfer credit. As noted above, students with an M.A. (with thesis) in Latin American Studies from Tulane may transfer up to 30 credits of relevant work from their M.A. program, while students transferring from other departments at Tulane or other universities may transfer up to 12 hours of relevant coursework. Acceptance of graduate credit for work done in other M.A. programs at Tulane or other universities is recommended by the Graduate Advisor and approved by the Dean of the School of Liberal Arts. To be considered for transfer credit, coursework must have received a grade of 3.0 or better on a 4.0 scale and must have been completed no more than six years before the date of first registration in the Center’s doctoral program. Only in very special cases, and with the recommendation of the Stone Center’s Graduate Advisor, will the Dean consider transfer of credit for courses taken earlier. Language Requirements The language requirement for graduation with the Ph.D. in Latin American Studies is demonstrated competence in two languages. Normally, one is Spanish; the second Portuguese. However, other languages may be presented if essential for the student’s research. German, Quechua, Nahuatl, or Kaqchikel are examples. Students are expected to pass a language examination in Spanish or Portuguese during the first year of study. The required level of competence in Spanish and Portuguese corresponds to “intermediate-high’‘ on the American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Language ( ACTFL ) scale or the Avant STAMP 4S scale. This competency is considered a minimum requirement. Students are encouraged to develop additional languages as needed by their research fields. Levels of competency similar to those described for Spanish and Portuguese are required in any language presented to satisfy this requirement. Currently, language competency is determined by performance on the Avant STAMP 4S examinations, which are administered by the Language Learning Center ( https://liberalarts.tulane.edu/language-learning-center/language-testing/proficiency ). All students, even native speakers, must be either examined for minimal linguistic competency as explained above or certified as to their native fluency by the Spanish and Portuguese Department. Certification of competency in a second language must be presented by the end of the second year of study. Transfer students are expected to pass one language during the first year of study, and a second language examination by the end of second year of study. Testing in languages that are not available through the Avant STAMP 4S process in the Language Learning Center should be discussed with the Graduate Advisor to determine if such testing is possible and what would be the procedures for such testing.\n",

At Tulane, we look at how languages change over time (historical linguistics); how language varies from situation to situation, group to group, and place to place (sociolinguistics, dialectology); how people use language in context (pragmatics, discourse analysis); how to model aspects of language (computational linguistics); how people acquire or learn language (language acquisition); and how people process language (psycholinguistics, brain and language). The array of courses offered by the Program allows linguistics majors to master the basics of the discipline. Linguistics majors develop valuable intellectual skills in analytical reasoning and critical thinking, lucid communication, and the use of research methodologies. Career opportunities for linguistics majors are: publishing, computer industry, foreign language education, advertising, national security, translating/interpreting, speech and language pathology. The major in linguistics consists of ten courses selected from the lists below. The student should take at least one course in each of the following areas: phonology, morphosyntax, language history, and language and thought.

      "Linguistics, MA Overview Requirements 4+1 MA in Linguistics The Linguistics Program at Tulane offers an accelerated Master of Arts program in Linguistics to enrolled seniors. Students choosing this fast-track option must take 6 graduate credits (2 courses) while still completing undergraduate course work. These 6 graduate credits are in addition to the 30 credits required for the Bachelor’s degree in Linguistics. They will count toward the 30 graduate credits (10 courses) required for the MA in Linguistics, although they may also be used to fulfill one or two of the four area requirements for the undergraduate Linguistics major (Phonology, Morphosyntax, Language History, Language and Thought). Having earned these 6 graduate credits while completing the undergraduate major, student in the 4+1 MA program will take just 24 graduate credits (8 courses) during their fifth year. This program allows students to bypass the time commitment and anxiety of the graduate admissions process and places them within a year of obtaining their Master’s degree upon graduating with their Bachelor’s degree. 4+1 MA in Linguistics Courses Students are required to take 10 out of the following courses: Course List Course ID Title Credits ANTH 6400 Language and Culture 3 ANTH 6420 Linguistic Field Methods 3 ANTH 7290 Linguistic Analysis 3 ANTH 7310 Prehistory of Languages 3 ANTH 7340 Dialectology 3 ANTH 7590 Syntactic Theory 3 ANTH 7630 Linguistic Phonetics 3 ANTH 7640 Phonology 3 ANTH 7650 Morphology 3 ANTH 7660 Discourse Analysis 3 ANTH 7670 Language & Acquisition 3 ANTH 7680 Language and Power 3 ANTH 7690 Language and Gender 3 ANTH 7780 Language Death 3 ANTH 7930 Languages of Louisiana 3 FREN 6085 Pidgins and Creoles 3 LING 7010 Semantics 3\n",

      "Linguistics, PhD Overview Requirements Linguistics is a major that gives students insight into one of the most intriguing aspects of human knowledge and behavior. Majoring in linguistics means that you will learn about many aspects of human language, including sounds (phonetics, phonology), words (morphology), sentences (syntax), and meaning (semantics). At Tulane, we look at how languages change over time (historical linguistics); how language varies from situation to situation, group to group, and place to place (sociolinguistics, dialectology); how people use language in context (pragmatics, discourse analysis); how to model aspects of language (computational linguistics); how people acquire or learn language (language acquisition); and how people process language (psycholinguistics, brain and language). Our PhD program is unique because it is the only university-level interdisciplinary linguistics program in New Orleans and in the state at large, as well as one of only three in the Gulf South. We have unique resources, physical and human: (1) the Roger Thayer Stone Center for Latin American Studies, (2) the Cuban and Caribbean Studies Institute, (3) the Women’s Center, (4) the Amistad Center, (5) the New Orleans Center for the Gulf South, (6) the Latin American Library, (7) the Louisiana Collection, (8) An enticing mix of less commonly taught languages (for example, Kaqchikel, Nahuatl, Yucatec Maya, Spoken Yoruba, Diaspora Yoruba, Swahili, Haitian Creole, Classical languages and writings of the Maya), (9) a growing computer science program with strong emphasis on artificial intelligence and human cognition, and (10) a committed faculty. The Linguistics Ph.D. program at Tulane is highly competitive. All students admitted to the program receive a stipend and a tuition waiver for five years. If you are interested in applying to the program, please contact the faculty member(s) with whom you are interested in working. You may also contact the Director of the program at ling@tulane.edu . As a graduate student in linguistics, you are required to complete 48 hours of course work before advancement to candidacy, which will include at least one course drawn from each of the following categories: Acoustic phonetics Phonology Morphology or syntax Language variation and change (for instance, sociolinguistics, historical linguistics, dialectology, bilingual education, or multilingualism) Semantics, pragmatics, philosophy of language, or discourse A non-Indo-European language other than your native language (Note that this requirement can be satisfied by one of the Less Commonly Taught Languages offered at the 1000 level, which will be covered by the tuition waiver as long as you are a full-time student, but a course below the 6000 level cannot count towards graduate credit. Non-Indo-European languages taught in the Anthropology Department are 6000 level and above and so would count toward the graduate program as well as fulfilling this requirement.) Depending on your previous course work and training, you may be able to waive some of these courses. Course waivers are to be requested on an individual basis, and must be approved by the program graduate adviser. This range of courses ensures that you will receive a rigorous and broad background in linguistics, which will prepare you for your own research projects and will make you highly qualified for the job market. You should normally enroll in 12 credit hours (4 courses) per semester until you have completed the required course work for the Ph.D., which will normally take 4-5 semesters, depending on your background. This ensures that you will fulfill Tulane's residency requirement of four semesters of full-time study at the university, as well as Tulane's minimum course-hour requirements. (See the university graduate requirements for more information on Tulane's residency and course-hour requirements.) In all of your course work, a grade level of B- (B minus) is the formal minimum for a passing performance in the graduate program. Although a grade of B- is a passing grade, it is considered a \"weak\" pass. One or two B- grades can be cause for probation or dismissal. In addition to your course grades, however, the general assessment of your overall progress in the program will also include the opinions of the faculty. The faculty meets at the end of each semester to discuss graduate students' progress. Renewal of your fellowship from year to year is dependent upon continuing satisfactory progress in your studies. Language of Scholarship Requirement In addition to taking at least one course in a non-Indo-European language, you must show competence in a major language of published scholarship other than English. You should meet with your adviser or the program director to discuss your proposed language and your plan for fulfilling the requirement. This requirement must be filled before advancement to candidacy. If your native language is a major language of published scholarship other than English, you can use English to satisfy this requirement. For everyone else, competence can be demonstrated by (i) two semesters of language instruction at the junior (3000) level or above, or (ii) a translation exam. Comprehensive Examinations Students must take two Ph.D. comprehensive examinations, a general examination covering all major fields of linguistics and a special field examination tailored to their chosen field of dissertation research. The general comprehensive examination is to be taken in early September of the student’s third year (fifth semester) in the program, and the special field examination is to be taken in early to mid-January of the third year (sixth semester). You may petition the program to substitute a published paper for the special field exam. Dissertation Prospectus Immediately after taking your special field examination, if not before, you should form your dissertation committee. It must consist of at least three tenured or tenure-track Tulane faculty members. Your committee may have additional members as well, but this is not required. Your first task with the dissertation committee is to write a research paper, called the dissertation prospectus. The prospectus should consist of a substantial dissertation proposal and a comprehensive bibliography. It may be based on a grant proposal to an external funding agency, particularly in the case of proposed fieldwork. The work described in the prospectus should lead naturally into your dissertation. The prospectus should contain a statement of the topic area of your proposed dissertation project, a problem statement, a statement of the theoretical orientation and methodology, and a comprehensive bibliography. Work out the specific details of your prospectus with the members of your dissertation committee. Once it is complete, you will schedule an oral defense of the prospectus before the members of your committee. The prospectus defense should take place before the end of your third year (sixth semester) in the program. Advancement to Candidacy After you have passed your comprehensive examinations and your language requirement and your dissertation committee has approved your prospectus, you will apply for Candidacy for the Ph.D. Once you have advanced, you are considered 'ABD' (All But Dissertation). Application for some research grants requires this status. Fieldwork You may find it necessary to conduct fieldwork before writing your dissertation. You are encouraged to seek outside funding to support your fieldwork. If you succeed in securing outside funding to replace your Tulane stipend for one year, you may be eligible to bank that year of stipend for use in your sixth year. If your research does not require you to absent yourself in order to pursue fieldwork, you may continue directly to writing your dissertation. Teaching You will normally be expected to teach undergraduate-level linguistics classes during one year of your time on stipend. In some cases you may be asked to perform other duties, such as serving as a research assistant, in lieu of teaching. Writing, filing, and defending the dissertation Following advancement to candidacy, you will normally be eligible for a fifth year of financial support to work full time toward the completion of the dissertation. Receiving your final year of fellowship is contingent upon your having met the following requirements: Achievement of ABD status Submission of an acceptable plan for research and writing during the final year of support Completion of the language requirements Students generally find writing a dissertation to be a challenging and rewarding process. However, it is also an inherently stressful activity. For this reason, you should meet regularly with the members of your committee at every stage of your project, and keep in touch with them about data collection and writing. And finally, remember that all of the faculty members have also written a dissertation (and likely supervised a number of them too), and are happy to discuss any issues that come up for you. Upon completion of an acceptable draft of your dissertation, you will then, in consultation with the chair of your dissertation committee, schedule a public defense of your work. All members of the Tulane community are invited to the defense, and anyone else is welcome to attend. You should prepare a short presentation of your work, summarizing the main research question(s), how you went about doing your project, and your key findings. Your dissertation committee will then ask you questions about your dissertation, as may other members of the audience, time permitting. There are a host of important deadlines to keep track of, as well as very specific formatting minutia which you must strictly follow in order to file the dissertation. Consult the relevant sections of Deadlines for Graduating Students . As always, you are ultimately responsible for being aware of and complying with all formal requirements and university deadlines. After you have submitted a complete draft of your dissertation, defended it publicly, and made any revisions suggested by your committee, you are ready to file the dissertation. Tulane's general guidelines permit a maximum of seven years from your initial matriculation to file the Ph.D. When the final version of the dissertation is accepted by the doctoral committee and filed with the university, and all other requirements are certified as fulfilled, you have earned a Ph.D. in Linguistics!\n",

If a student receives two grades of B-, or one grade less than B-, during his/her tenure in the School of Science and Engineering, the student is placed on probation and considered for dismissal by the Associate Dean in consultation with the appropriate department/program.” A student who does not maintain the minimum 3.0 GPA in graduate course work will be subject to disenrollment. To continue in the program, MPE students must have a minimum 3.2 GPA from a minimum 8 graduate courses by the end of the 4th semester, not including research courses. Oral Qualifying Exam: The Ph.D. oral qualifying exam is presented by the student to a committee of three materials faculty at Tulane, chosen in consultation with the research supervisor and the graduate program advisor. A student must choose three research articles in agreement with committee members, one approved by each committee member, with each representative of a different topic in MPE not including the student’s specific research area. The student must present a maximum 10 minute overview of the paper followed by about 20 minutes of questions on that topic. The exam duration is 1.5 to 2 hours total. The student must attempt the oral qualifying exam by the end of the 4th semester. A second attempt is allowed and must be completed by the end of the fifth week of the fifth semester (two total attempts allowed). The committee votes pass/fail on each paper topic, with unanimous agreement required to pass that topic. A student must pass all three topics. If one or more is failed, the student is allowed one additional chance to pass the failed topics, but with a different research article for each (again agreed between the student and committee). Passed topics do not need to be repeated in the 2nd attempt. Any student who has not passed the qualifying exam by the end of the fifth semester of graduate study will be disenrolled from the program. Students who have met course and GPA requirements and have passed the qualifying exam become degree candidates. Those who have not are required to attend the weekly departmental colloquium. Faculty Dissertation Committee: Prior to the prospectus defense, the student and research supervisor form the faculty dissertation committee, which consists of the research supervisor (chair) and at least two other faculty members. One member may be from another Tulane department or other appropriate institution. The faculty dissertation committee (henceforth the committee) examines the student at the prospectus defense and oral dissertation defense, and approves the final written dissertation. Prospectus Defense: The prospectus defense demonstrates to the committee that the student has acquired sufficient knowledge in the specific research area and can effectively express that knowledge orally and in writing. A student must pass the oral qualifying exam before undertaking the prospectus defense. The prospectus defense consists of a written proposal and an oral defense: The written research proposal (10-15 pages) contains an introduction, proposed research and justification, methods, preliminary results, and discussion. It must be reviewed and approved by the committee before the end of the sixth semester of graduate study. The oral defense is a two-hour oral examination, including a research presentation (about 45 minutes) prepared by the student, given by the committee. The examination includes specific questions about the student's research as well as broadly focused questions on the general area of research. The oral defense must be attempted following approval of the written proposal, no later than the sixth semester of graduate study. If failed, the student is normally given a second attempt in the following semester. After two failures the student will be disenrolled from the program. Students who are sufficiently prepared are strongly encouraged to take the prospectus defense before the end of the 4th semester of graduate study. It is expected that, after completion of the oral prospectus defense, the Ph.D. candidate will obtain a Research Assistantship (RA) in the same research group. In order to encourage this, the faculty have adopted a policy for allocating graduate students on TA's to research groups. Annual Report: In April of each year, every Ph.D. student will submit a brief annual progress report (1-2 pages) to the research supervisor (and committee, when formed) summarizing research progress and accomplishments over the previous year, and future plans and milestones. This requirement is waived in the years when the prospectus and thesis defenses are completed. Dissertation: The final requirement for the Ph.D. degree is a written dissertation based on original research, approved by the committee, and its defense in an oral exam by the committee. Master's Degree: The master's degree is not a requirement for the Ph.D. in Materials Physics and Engineering. Admission with financial aid is only for doctoral students. However a graduate student may receive an M.S. in Physics based on 30 hours of approved graduate credit, or (if the research supervisor agrees to offer this option) an M.S. in Physics based on 24 hours of approved graduate credit plus a thesis deemed acceptable by the research supervisor. Research course credit does not count toward the M.S. in Physics degree. Program Transfers: Students in the Materials Physics and Engineering Ph.D. program cannot transfer to the Physics Ph.D. program without going through the regular admissions process. Exceptions to the requirements, due to extenuating circumstances, may be granted by vote of the PEP faculty. The Materials Physics and Engineering program requirements were last modified in Fall 2018. The requirements for students matriculating prior to Fall 2018 may be found here .

Suggested Curriculum Students should enroll in an appropriate calculus course in their first year of study. Students with no prior calculus course should normally take MATH 1210 Calculus I (4 c.h.) and MATH 1220 Calculus II (4 c.h.) , while students with one semester of calculus credit (or equivalent knowledge) should take MATH 1310 Consolidated Calculus (4 c.h.) . Students with two semesters of calculus credit should start in MATH 2210 Calculus III (4 c.h.) and contact a mathematics major advisor during the first semester for major program planning advice.  Students are encouraged to complete the core courses as early as possible in their programs. It is generally recommended to take MATH 3090 Linear Algebra (4 c.h.) before MATH 3050 Real Analysis I (3 c.h.) , but they can be taken concurrently. The MATH 3070 - MATH 3080 sequence provides the foundation for upper-level courses in probability and statistics. The Senior Seminar MATH 3980 - MATH 3990 is strongly recommended for majors who are not completing an honors thesis. Students considering a math major should arrange an appointment with the department Director of Undergraduate Studies early in their program. They will be assigned a major advisor who will advise them on course selection within the major. The major program is designed to provide the student with a solid foundation during the first two years and provide for a variety of programs of study during the junior and senior years. A major program in mathematics can provide a background for both graduate study and work in a variety of areas of the mathematical sciences as well as provide preparation for professional schools such as law, medicine, and business.

      "Mathematics, PhD Overview Requirements Senior Undergraduate students majoring in mathematics or other sciences with a strong interest in mathematics, and people who already hold undergraduate degrees in mathematics or other sciences, are encouraged to apply for admission to PhD program in Mathematics.  Faculty in the Mathematics Department have active research in areas of Algebra, Domain Theory and Theoretical Computer Science, Geometry and Topology, Symbolic Analysis, Applied Mathematics and Partial Differential Equations, Computational Mathematics, Mathematical Biology, Probability and Statistics. Below is a brief outline of the requirements and further explanation of each step. Complete at least 48 hours of coursework-up to two courses may be taken in another department with the approval of the Graduate Studies Committee. For advanced incoming students, limited transfer credit is possible. Pass the Placement Exam in linear algebra and advanced calculus. It will be taken at the beginning of the fall semester (the student’s first semester). If a student fails to achieve A- in the linear algebra portion, he or she will be required to enroll in MATH 3090 Linear Algebra (4 c.h.) / MATH 6090 Linear Algebra (3 c.h.) . If the student fails to achieve A- in the advanced calculus portion, he or she will be required to enroll in MATH 4060 Real Analysis II (3 c.h.) / MATH 6060 Real Analysis II (3 c.h.) . Read the Placement Exam syllabus for details and previous exams. Pass qualifying written exams Analysis and two others chosen from among: Algebra , Analysis , Applied Mathematics , Differential Geometry , Probability and Statistics , PDE , Scientific Computation , and Topology . Read the exam syllabi for qualifying exams Pass an oral exam on specific topics of research interest to the student. Write a dissertation. Credit Hours The Ph.D. program requires students to complete at least 48 credits. This is equivalent to 16 courses (math courses are 3 credits each). All 7000-level courses may count toward the Ph.D. degree. Students in need of remediation, for example whose undergraduate major was not mathematics, may be advised by the Graduate Coordinator to take some undergraduate courses as 6000-level, but these cannot count toward the Ph.D. degree. Exceptions are 6210 (Differential Geometry) and 6300 (Complex Analysis). These two can be taken for Ph.D. credit if the Graduate Coordinator approves. It is not enough for a student to complete 48 credits to satisfy this requirement. The credits must be approved by the Graduate Coordinator and must be taken in such a way that they represent breadth and depth. Owing to these concerns, It is important that the student work closely with the Graduate Coordinator in order to formulate a sequence of courses that will satisfy the coursework requirement. This is done on an individual basis. A student who does not consult with the Graduate Coordinator may find that not all classes taken count toward the degree. Up to two courses may be taken in other departments when approved by the Graduate Studies Committee. At most two reading courses in total can be counted toward the required 48 credit hours. In addition, the transfer of up to 9 credits from another graduate program is possible with the approval of the Graduate Studies Committee. Read more about transfer credit » Placement Exam This is a 4-hour exam on topics from undergraduate courses on Linear Algebra & Vector Calculus. This exam is generally offered during the first week of each semester. A sign-up sheet is available in the math office near the end of the preceding semester. Every first-year PhD student has to take the placement exam prior to his/her first semester at Tulane. The topics covered in the Preliminary Exam are: Linear Algebra vector spaces inner products linear transformations linear equations matrix operations determinants characteristic equation eigenvalues and eigenvectors symmetric, skew-symmetric matrices hermitian, skew-hermitian matrices Jordan canonical form spectral theorem Vector Calculus limits in Rn partial derivatives differentiable functions of several variables optimization of functions in Rn (with and without constraints) the implicit function theorem the inverse function theorem Taylor's theorem integration in several variables line integrals the theorems of Green, Gauss and Stokes References you may want to study: Linear Algebra, Mathematica Labs by Terry Lawson Linear Algebra and Its Applications , 3rd ed., by Gilbert Strang Almost any textbook with Linear Algebra in its title Calculus by Boyce and DiPrima Almost any textbook with Advanced Calculus in its title Qualifying Exams These are comprehensive written exams. The student must pass three exams one in Analysis and two others chosen from among: Algebra Analysis Applied Mathematics Differential Geometry Probability and Statistics PDE Scientific Computation Topology The topics of each exam are based on the corresponding first-year graduate course sequence. For example, the Analysis exam covers roughly the material in MATH 7210 Analysis I (3 c.h.) - MATH 7220 Analysis II (3 c.h.) . Read the Qualifying exam syllabi Qualifying exams are offered the first week of each semester. A sign-up sheet is available in the math office near the end of the spring semester for the following semester’s exams. Students do not have to take all three exams at the same time; however, they should complete all three exams by the beginning of the third year in the Ph.D. program. Oral Exam After a Ph.D. student has passed the Preliminary exam and three Qualifying exams, the student should: decide on the area of mathematics in which he/she would like to write a dissertation (and) choose an advisor in this area The advisor and the student will decide on a reading list and topics for the oral exam. The exam usually lasts one to two hours and consists of a committee of 5 faculty who ask questions from the list of topics. The student and the advisor must choose the committee and set the date of the exam. This information must be communicated to the Graduate Coordinator prior to the exam for approval by the Graduate Studies Committee. It is not necessary that the student complete all coursework before taking the oral exam. Prospectus SSE requires a written prospectus. The Mathematics Department requires in addition that the student gives an oral presentation of the prospectus to the committee. Students are encouraged to write a 4-8-page double-spaced prospectus and prepare a 40-minute presentation for the dissertation committee followed by discussion and questions.  A suggested format is: 1. Cover sheet: should state the student’s name, department/program, the title of the proposed dissertation, and the name of the chair and the other members of the committee. 2. Introduction: a summary of earlier work on the problem, including a substantial number of references. 3. Statement of the dissertation problem: containing the goal of the thesis, possible sub-problems, and their importance in the global view of the field. 4. Investigation plan: containing an orderly description of the major steps of the investigation that will accomplish the goal of the thesis.  This is the plan you propose to follow in order to accomplish the goal and the committee should be convinced that the plan is likely to be successful. 5. Expected results: This section should include expected (partial) results of each major step of the investigation plan. 6. References: Major sources of information should be indicated, and a selective bibliography included. The prospectus should be submitted to the Dean’s Graduate Programs office along with a signed copy of the prospectus approval form. Dissertation The dissertation must contain original work by the student and demonstrate the student’s ability to carry on independent research that results in a genuine contribution to the field. The student must work closely with his/her advisor in order to have a clear vision of what is required of the dissertation. The student's dissertation committee must sign the dissertation to accept it before it can be submitted to the SSE . The student must also give a presentation of the research in the dissertation as an oral defense.

      "MD/MBA Overview Requirements Applicants interested in additional information on MD degree options, contact the Office of Admissions and Student Affairs at the Medical School: Hours: Monday - Friday 8:00 a.m. - 4:00 p.m. (CST) Phone: 504-988-5331 Email: medsch@tulane.edu For information on MBA degree options, contact the Office of Graduate Admissions at the Freeman School: Hours: Monday - Friday 8:30 a.m. - 5:00 p.m. (CST) Phone: 504-865-5410 Email: abfadmit@tulane.edu NOTE: Students must first be accepted into the School of Medicine before they are eligible to apply for the combined degree programs. Future leaders in medicine must excel as clinicians as well as managers in the complex and rapidly evolving environment that now dominates healthcare. A growing number of medical students and physicians are complementing their medical education with MBA degrees. Holders of both degrees can operate their clinics more effectively, run a healthcare organization, manage a research project, or advocate for their patients and work to fix the healthcare system. The School of Medicine is partnering with the internationally-recognized A. B. Freeman School of Business to offer medical students two options for completing a joint MD/MBA program. These options allow students to earn both degrees more rapidly than when done separately. Three additional options are available for those who have already completed the medical degree. MBA Overview In the MBA program, required courses teach business fundamentals including finance, management, operations, accounting, statistics, and marketing. Elective courses allow students to focus their professional or personal interests in areas such as strategic management and innovation, analytics, real estate, and entrepreneurship. Students develop the ability to analyze opportunities for and likelihood of success of organizations operating in various environments. 4-Year Program for Newly-Admitted MD Students In the accelerated business curriculum of the four-year program, students take courses at the Freeman School of Business in the summer prior to and the summer following the first year of medical school. Students then complete their business education throughout the remainder of their time at the medical school. Participants take some courses together with Freeman students in the part-time, Professional MBA (PMBA) program, benefiting from their work experience and the opportunity to collaborate on projects with non-clinicians. Students apply to the MBA program upon acceptance to the medical school.

      "MD/MPH Overview Requirements Program Options Applicants interested in additional information on MD degrees, contact the Office of Admissions and Student Affairs: Hours: Monday – Friday 8:00 a.m. – 4:00 p.m. (CST) Phone: 504-988-5331 Email: medsch@tulane.edu MD/MPH program information, contact Rachael Ruiz Currier, 504-988-7055 | rruiz1@tulane.edu NOTE: Students must first be accepted into the School of Medicine before they are eligible to apply for the combined degree program. Tulane's MD/MPH combined degree program is open to students who have been accepted to Tulane's School of Medicine and who wish to pursue both an MD from Tulane and an MPH from Tulane's School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine (SPHTM). The MD/MPH program is a global, integrated program in an excellent learning environment which: Integrates healthcare training for individuals and populations; Provides the foundation for a holistic approach to patient care; Encompasses diverse and challenged populations domestically and internationally; Provides in-depth training in population and public health knowledge, behaviors, and skills; and, Allows students to match their specific population interest with a degree concentration in the School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine. Program Information Tulane's MD/MPH combined degree program offers Tulane School of Medicine students a unique opportunity to build on their patient-based medical education with a population-based public health degree. The combined degree program is designed to be completed in four or five years, integrating the requirements for the School of Medicine with those from the School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine. Browse the links below to learn more general information about the program. To receive the MD/MPH combined degree, students must fulfill all requirements for graduation from both schools before the graduation deadline. While students develop MD/MPH competencies specific to both their medical and public health curricula (see below for links to specific competencies), the competency that bridges the public health curriculum with the medical school curriculum is that MD/MPH students graduate from the MD/MPH program with the ability to use educational experiences in the School of Medicine to apply population-based and public health findings and principles in assessing individuals and groups at risk of disease and injury and to translate these findings and principles into recommendations and actions for improved health in clinical practice settings. SPHTM Requirements and Competencies In addition to completing their School of Medicine curriculum, MD/MPH combined degree students must also complete the following requirements: Required core and programmatic courses in the School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine (SPHTM) Practicum (fulfilled, in part, with MD/MPH rotation) Culminating experience. All MD/MPH students are required to complete a culminating experience which requires students to synthesize and integrate knowledge acquired in coursework and other learning experiences. Your culminating experience should demonstrate to your public health advisor that you have mastered the body of knowledge and can demonstrate proficiency in core and departmental competencies. Additional departmental requirements: each department has specific requirements for programmatic and elective courses and the culminating experience. In some cases, departments may have additional requirements that students should verify with their SPHTM department. Students should verify all requirements with their SPHTM department and should make contact with their advisors each semester to verify their progress toward their degrees. MD/MPH competencies for each department mirror that department's general competencies, which are available at the following links: Epidemiology - MPH in Epidemiology competencies Global Biostatistics and Data Science - MSPH in Biostatistics competencies Global Community Health and Behavioral Science - MPH in Community Health Sciences competencies Environmental Health Sciences - MPH in Disaster Management competencies Health Management and Policy - MPH in Health Systems Management competencies Tropical Medicine - MPH&TM competencies SOM Requirements MD Requirements Courses in the School of Medicine that provide public health content and that MD/MPH combined degree students are required to take include the following: Foundations in Medicine I & II Family and Community Medicine clerkship MD/MPH one-month rotation (3rd or 4th year) Medical microbiology Genetics Clinical diagnosis (evidence-based medicine) Any changes in the School of Medicine curriculum that reduce the public health content courses may require that MD/MPH combined degree students complete additional credit hours in the School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine to meet degree requirements. Generally, MD students are able to complete only a single combined degree during their customary time at SOM.  Multiple combined degrees are generally not possible or advisable. Tulane's MD/MPH program offers the following two options for students who have (1) earned a baccalaureate degree, and (2) already been admitted to Tulane University School of Medicine (SOM) and who wish to complete the requirements for both the medical degree and public health degree: Four-Year Option (for incoming or T1 SOM students) Applicants to the 4-year program must have earned a 28 or higher on the MCAT and/or a 504 or higher on the MCAT2015. Requirements for the MD/MPH combined degree should be completed within 4 years: students must graduate with both degrees concurrently. Students are strongly encouraged to begin the combined degree program the summer before their SOM curriculum begins. Students may begin the four-year program as late as the spring of their T1 year. If you have been admitted to SOM, you can apply for the four-year program.  Please email Adam Maese for an application form. Five-Year Option (for T2 or T3 SOM students) Students who will require more than 4 years to complete the requirements for the medical and the public health degrees are also eligible for the MD/MPH combined degree program. Students choose this option for a variety of reasons, including a desire to focus exclusively on public health for a year, career exploration, Couples Match timing, and a host of other personal reasons. In the five-year option, students must graduate with both degrees concurrently. The most common path for these students is to take a leave of absence from SOM after either the T2 or T3 year of medical school. Students who choose this option have been admitted to SOM and are generally in their T2 or T3 years. Students may also begin the program by pursuing the four-year option and then opt to take a year off from SOM to complete the MD/MPH combined degree in five years. The requirements for both options are the same; however, the application process differs. T4 students are not eligible to begin their public health studies as part of the five-year program in the MD/MPH combined degree program. However, T4 SOM students who wish to pursue a public health degree are encouraged to pursue their public health degree as a non-combined-degree student by applying directly to the School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine and completing the public health curriculum for non-combined-degree students. A student may not receive the MD degree and then continue working on MPH requirements as part of the MD/MPH combined degree program. A student may graduate with the MD degree and may continue working towards their public health degree, but must meet the full MPH, MSPH, or MPH&TM requirements for non-combined-degree students. MD/MPH students can discuss the non-combined-degree public health requirements with their public health advisors if they wish to delay completing their MPH requirements until after they earn their MD degrees.\n",

      "Major: MD/MS in Bioethics - Home Content\n",
      "MD/MS in Bioethics Overview Requirements This 33 - credit - hour program leading to a Master of Science in Bioethics and Medical Humanities is completed while earning the MD, with all coursework normally completed in the first two years of the MD program. The MS is granted at the same time as the MD and adds no additional time to the four years of medical school . MS coursework is done on Wednesday and Friday afternoons — reserved specifically in Years 1 and 2 for all of the School of Medicine's dual degree program students and for medical student electives — and through elective coursework offered in the summers before and after Year 1. Students in professional schools may also complete the program in its one-year format in a gap year, allowing them to graduate with the MD and MS in 5 total years. The core courses provide essential grounding in the foundations of bioethics and medical humanities, current controversies in health care ethics, and the social and ethical contexts of health care decision-making; participation in hospital rounds emphasizes the practical realities of clinical ethics, and a capstone seminar integrates program courses with one another and with students’ experience in the health care professions. The program also offers elective courses and with permission other relevant courses from other schools and departments at Tulane University may be taken as electives. Students can focus on either bioethics or medical humanities, and upon graduation will be well - suited for roles on clinical ethics committees and consultation, IRBs, and teaching ethics and medical humanities in schools of medicine and elsewhere.

Whatever studies you pursue, your learning will intersect with the city’s unique mix of influences- ethnic, musical, architectural, geographical, commercial, political, environmental, and social. Beyond the classroom and lab, Tulane also provides you with multiple opportunities for career development and possible career exploration, both in and outside of academia. As a Tulane graduate student, you will find unmatched opportunities:  opportunities to pursue ideas and work that matters to others, and opportunities to grow and mature. There are two tracks to receiving a combined MD/PHD degree, also known as the Physician Scientist Program (PSP).  Both tracks start with Medical School for 2 years, followed by 3-4 years in the BMS Phd program before returning to Medical School for the last 2 years. PSP-A students apply through the Medical School AMCAS application process for both degrees. Applicants cannot apply to the PSP-A program and Medical School.  They must choose one. 2 students are accepted each year. Must have exceptional academic credentials and prior research experience. Accepted students receive a fellowship covering both medical and graduate school tuition costs. A stipend is paid for the duration of study in both the Graduate School and Medical School. Accepted students must begin research lab rotations the summer prior to entry into medical school. Accepted students must complete both the PhD and MD degree. Track B or PSP-B students must have applied for and been accepted into Tulane Medical School. PSP-B track students apply for the PhD program through the Biomedical Sciences application system any time after beginning medical school studies but no later than the beginning of their third year of medical school. A stipend is paid for the duration of the program after acceptance. PSP-B students receive tuition remittance only for the PhD portion of their studies, not Medical School. MD Requirements Students complete their pre-clinical curriculum (first and second years) as a cohort and are registered by the School of Medicine Office of Admissions and Student Affairs.  First- and second-year students will receive information through email listservs and dean's hours about how and when to choose their preclinical electives. Third-year students complete their seven required clinical clerkships in a lock-step fashion.  Third-year students will receive information through email listservs and dean's hours about how and when to find information about their third-year clerkships through eMedley's eCurriculum, and how to request a particular clinical clerkship path. Fourth-year students select block dates for their required fourth-year rotations and electives through a lottery system.  Fourth-year students will receive information through email listservs and dean's hours about how to use eMedley's eCurriculum's registration and scheduling resources.

Students graduating after 2021 are advised that the Curriculum Committee may further reduce the maximum number of online electives that T4s may complete. PhD Curriculum In the first two semesters, all students take the identical core curriculum, described below. In conjunction with the course work in the first year, students rotate in 6-week blocks through three of the Program’s participating research laboratories of the student’s choice. This allows students to become more familiar with BMS research and faculty. Students should choose a Dissertation Advisor by the end of the second semester but must choose a Dissertation Advisor by the end of the third semester. Students may choose to further specify their study by choosing an Area of Research Emphasis (a Departmental Track in Anatomy, Biochemistry, Medical Genetics and Genomics, Microbiology and Immunology, Pathology, Pharmacology or Physiology). An area of research emphasis may add further course requirements beyond those required for the Biomedical Sciences PhD degree without specialization.

A minimum of 48 credit hours of course work and independent study is required for the PhD. All formal course work is to be completed within the first two years. Students may take Independent Study ( BMSP 7990 Independent Study (1-6 c.h.) or equivalent) for 1-6 credits per semester for a maximum of 12 credits total during the first two years. The remaining hours of coursework are selected from the elective curriculum by the student in consultation with the dissertation advisor.  Once coursework is completed, the student must demonstrate the ability to carry out independent study and research in a chosen field, as evidenced in the dissertation. Students ordinarily complete the requirements for the Ph.D. degree between four and seven years from the date of matriculation in the program. Physician/Scientist Program Requirements Medical School- Years 1 & 2 Our medical school first and second year curriculum provides the necessary foundation for graduates to be well prepared to enter any field of medicine. Emphasis has been placed on self-directed learning, integration of basic and clinical sciences, and more active forms of learning. Students’ medical careers begin with the White Coat Ceremony, which defines the commitment and dedication they have made to their patients and themselves as they enter medical school. Students learn basic science knowledge during the first two years in lectures, problem-based learning sessions, small group discussions, laboratories, and clinical correlations. In mid-June of the second year, students sit for Step 1 of the USMLE. Graduate School P/SP students enter the graduate years full-time after completing Step 1 of the USMLE. Students may elect to do a third research rotation, or if they have already completed two research rotations, may select a graduate program and a dissertation advisor, and begin work on their Ph.D. dissertation. Coursework during the graduate years emphasizes basic principles and concepts in biochemistry, biostatistics, genetics, and cell biology, with additional courses specific to the area of concentration. Additional program requirements include weekly seminar series, and student research presentations. All students take a online course in ethics and must complete a proposal-based Preliminary Examination, usually after the first year of graduate school. When the dissertation advisory committee is satisfied that the aims of the research project have been met and the dissertation has been defended successfully, the requirements for the Ph.D. will have been completed. P/SP students prepare to re-enter medical school as they near completion of their dissertation. Typically students begin medical school in July or mid-August with the third year medical student class. Students anticipating return to medical school notify the medical school in January and complete the clerkship selection process, which is coordinated by the Office of Student Affairs of the medical school. Up to 24 credit hours of coursework is transferred from the students’ medical school. Medical School - Years 3 & 4 P/SP students begin third year medical school clerkships about July 1 of their seventh year, after completing their Ph.D. dissertation. The majority of clinical training is offered in the third and fourth years. Tulane has created a “combined” third and fourth year, whereby students have 20 months of training, of which 15 are required and 5 are elective. The requirements for the third and fourth year include: 8-week clerkships in internal medicine, surgery, pediatrics, obstetrics/gynecology, and psychiatry/neurology, a 6 week clerkship in family medicine, 2 weeks of radiology, emergency medicine, and outpatient surgery, and 5 one month electives, one month of ambulatory internal medicine, and a sub-internship. Students are also required to participate in a new interdisciplinary seminar series in which students choose from a variety of offerings. The entire family medicine clerkship is an ambulatory based experience with a community preceptor, most of whom practice in rural settings. The medicine and surgery clerkships are in-patient experiences, while the other clerkships offer a balance of inpatient and outpatient experience Physician/Scientist Program Curriculum Medical School- Years 1 & 2 Our medical school first and second year curriculum provides the necessary foundation for graduates to be well prepared to enter any field of medicine.

Students must also register for Independent Study (BMSP 7990) or Selected topics (BMSP 7500) to maintain full time status. Second year will have no other formal didactic courses.  However, if a student chooses a mentor within a specific area of research emphasis, further requirements may be necessary. Medical School- Years 3 & 4 P/SP students begin third year medical school clerkships about July 1 of their seventh year, after completing their Ph.D. dissertation. The majority of clinical training is offered in the third and fourth years. Tulane has created a “combined” third and fourth year, whereby students have 20 months of training, of which 15 are required and 5 are elective. The requirements for the third and fourth year include: 8-week clerkships in internal medicine, surgery, pediatrics, obstetrics/gynecology, and psychiatry/neurology, a 6 week clerkship in family medicine, 2 weeks of radiology, emergency medicine, and outpatient surgery, and 5 one month electives, one month of ambulatory internal medicine, and a sub-internship. Students are also required to participate in a new interdisciplinary seminar series in which students choose from a variety of offerings. The entire family medicine clerkship is an ambulatory based experience with a community preceptor, most of whom practice in rural settings. The medicine and surgery clerkships are in-patient experiences, while the other clerkships offer a balance of inpatient and outpatient experience Physician/Scientist Program Curriculum Medical School- Years 1 & 2 Our medical school first and second year curriculum provides the necessary foundation for graduates to be well prepared to enter any field of medicine. Emphasis has been placed on self-directed learning, integration of basic and clinical sciences, and more active forms of learning. Students’ medical careers begin with the White Coat Ceremony, which defines the commitment and dedication they have made to their patients and themselves as they enter medical school. Students learn basic science knowledge during the first two years in lectures, problem-based learning sessions, small group discussions, laboratories, and clinical correlations. In mid-June of the second year, students sit for Step 1 of the USMLE. Graduate School P/SP students enter the graduate years full-time after completing Step 1 of the USMLE. Students may elect to do a third research rotation, or if they have already completed two research rotations, may select a graduate program and a dissertation advisor, and begin work on their Ph.D. dissertation. Coursework during the graduate years emphasizes basic principles and concepts in biochemistry, biostatistics, genetics, and cell biology, with additional courses specific to the area of concentration. Additional program requirements include weekly seminar series, and student research presentations. All students take a online course in ethics and must complete a proposal-based Preliminary Examination, usually after the first year of graduate school. When the dissertation advisory committee is satisfied that the aims of the research project have been met and the dissertation has been defended successfully, the requirements for the Ph.D. will have been completed. P/SP students prepare to re-enter medical school as they near completion of their dissertation.

      "Medicine, MD Overview Requirements The curriculum for the School of Medicine is designed to prepare future physicians with the knowledge, skills, and behaviors required for any specialty field they choose. The pre-clinical curriculum (years 1 and 2) is taught as a series of system-based modules that progress through two phases. In Phase I, the foundational courses of histology, physiology, biochemistry, and genetics, along with foundations in medicine are organized into system-based modules structured to provide normal structure and function, while still maintaining the identity of each course. Phase II begins in the latter portion of Year 1 and provides the foundational knowledge and skills necessary for understanding pathophysiology and disease states, also in system-based modules containing microbiology, immunology, pathology, pharmacology, behavioral and neurosciences, and clinical medicine. Students begin learning clinical skills early in Year 1. Specialty-based clinical training begins in May of Year 2 and continues throughout most of Year 3.  The final phase of the curriculum is designed to help students choose and prepare for their residency choice while enhancing skills in emergency medicine, radiology and cultural competence. The curriculum provides enough flexibility for early and numerous opportunities in community service and service-learning, dedicated time for students interested in dual degrees (MPH, MBA), or mentored research. Pre-clinical MD curriculum in the School of Medicine is available only to those students who have been accepted into Tulane's MD program. Clinical MD electives in the School of Medicine may be available to visiting students from United States medical schools who apply and are accepted for individual electives through AAMC's VSAS/VSLO platform. Tulane School of Medicine does not offer electives to visiting students from international schools of medicine. Current MD students in the School of Medicine should log into eMedley's eCurriculum for additional registration details, and for more details about courses and rotations, such as objectives, syllabi, permission to add, etc. Degree requirements Students complete their pre-clinical curriculum (first and second years) as a cohort and are registered by the School of Medicine Office of Admissions and Student Affairs.  First- and second-year students will receive information through email listservs and dean's hours about how and when to choose their preclinical electives. Third-year students complete their seven required clinical clerkships in a lock-step fashion.  Third-year students will receive information through email listservs and dean's hours about how and when to find information about their third-year clerkships through eMedley's eCurriculum, and how to request a particular clinical clerkship path. Fourth-year students select block dates for their required fourth-year rotations and electives through a lottery system.  Fourth-year students will receive information through email listservs and dean's hours about how to use eMedley's eCurriculum's registration and scheduling resources.

      "Music, MA Overview Requirements The Department of Music offers the Master of Arts degree in Musicology and Composition. M.A. in Musicology with a concentration on New Orleans Music The M.A. program allows students to take advantage of the unique musical culture of New Orleans while pursuing a rigorous curriculum in musicology. Study is focused on music and culture of the American South, the Caribbean, Latin America, Africa, and Europe and especially their interrelation in New Orleans. Methods of historical musicology, ethnomusicology, and musical theory are utilized in the interpretation and analysis of jazz, ragtime, classical, blues, funk, hip-hop, and other forms, while emphasizing the geographic and social context in which the music has been produced. Resources include the Hogan Archive of New Orleans Jazz, the Maxwell Music Library, the Louisiana Collection, the Amistad Research Center, the Stone Center for Latin American Studies, and the seemingly limitless possibilities of interacting with local musicians and institutions. M.A. in Composition Music composition is about creativity, imagination, communication and collaboration. It requires highly developed multilinear critical analytical skills, excellent organizational skills and a great deal of attention to detail. Music brings people from different backgrounds and communities together, enhances creativity, develops imaginations and helps you to make emotional connections with people. Several of our Music Composition program alumni have had highly successful and diverse careers as composers of abstract music and as faculty members and administrators at major institutions. Many others have successfully aligned their creative endeavors with interdisciplinary pursuits in areas such as multimedia, music for film, music therapy, music business, music and management, or entertainment law. Over the years, the Music Composition program has also graduated many alumni who have had highly successful careers in other diverse disciplines: from the sciences, to medicine, to finance, mathematics, and management.

      "Native American Studies Minor Overview Requirements Though only 1.9% of the US population, Native Americans have played and continue to play an important part in American society.  Largely invisibilized by the foregrounding of other ethnic minority groups, Native Americans in the US struggle for recognition (federal, state, and local), for survival as cultural groups (cf.  Ile de Jean Charles evacuation/resettlement), and for basic rights (legal protections, religious freedom, education, health services, and subsistence).  Researchers at Tulane are actively involved with Native American tribes of Louisiana, working with them on issues of language and culture revitalization, displacement due to coastal erosion, health concerns and services, and equity issues.  There are many courses at Tulane that deal with Native American culture, history, and languages.  Through a structured introduction to these peoples and cultures, Tulane students can gain an appreciation for continuing contribution of these communities to the American story. Students will also have an opportunity to work closely with researchers collaborating with Native communities, learning as they contribute to projects bolstering indigenous lifeways. As Tulane is committed to increasing diversity, recognition of Native American presence, persistence and legacies (tangible and intangible) contributes to our educational mission. Mission:  To further understanding of indigenous peoples and the issues confronting their communities through engaged learning and research.

      "Neuroscience, MS Overview Requirements Tulane University offers two versions of its Master of Science degree in Neuroscience. One version is for students with baccalaureate degrees from other institutions. The other version is our 4 + 1 program for students who earned their B.S. at Tulane University. The purpose of the 4+1 M.S. Program in Neuroscience is to provide Tulane students with training at the graduate level for one additional year beyond the baccalaureate degree. Completion of an empirical master’s thesis under the guidance of an advisor who is a faculty member of the Tulane Brain Institute is optional. Students in both versions of the M.S. program take courses relevant to their interests in Neuroscience and related fields.   The mission of the M.S. program is to prepare students for admission to doctoral programs in the neurosciences, for admission to medical or other professional schools, or the workforce.  Completion of the M.S. program does not guarantee acceptance to Tulane's Ph.D. programs or medical school. Students pursuing an advanced degree in Neuroscience benefit from a multidisciplinary education and training in the sciences of the brain and nervous system. In addition, our students develop professional skills such as reading scientific literature, public speaking/presentations, and collaboration/team work. Students accepted to the Master’s in Neuroscience program may follow one of two tracks toward completion of an M.S. in Neuroscience. For the Thesis Track option (24 credit hours of coursework and 6 credits of research), students will take courses relevant to their interests in neuroscience or related fields and complete an empirical master’s thesis under the supervision of an adviser who is a member of the Tulane Brain Institute. Because completion of an empirical master’s thesis normally requires more than one year, students who plan to complete a thesis, should already be engaged in research that they can continue during the program. The thesis adviser will provide guidance in all aspects of the master’s thesis. For the Non-Thesis Track option (30 credit hours), students will take courses relevant to their interests in neuroscience or related fields, and may participate in research for credit, but are not required to complete an empirical master’s thesis. All MS students will meet with the M.S. program adviser to plan their course schedule. Graduation Requirements Students must complete 30 credits of coursework if they are pursuing the non-thesis track. If they decide to complete a Master's thesis, 24 credits of coursework, plus six credits of research and an empirical research thesis must be completed. 4+1 Required Courses Course List Course ID Title Credits NSCI 6030 Brain Institute Seminar 1 NSCI 6040 Trends In Neuroscience 1 NSCI 7110 Graduate Neuroscience I 3 NSCI 6400 Neuroscience Applied 3 M.S.

      "Neuroscience, PhD Overview Requirements The Neuroscience Doctoral Program is an interdisciplinary graduate program composed of doctoral students and faculty members from departments across five divisions and three campuses of Tulane University. As an educational branch of the Tulane Brain Institute, the program is administered through the School of Science and Engineering and governed by the Neuroscience Doctoral Training Committee. Appointed by the Director of the Tulane Brain Institute, the Committee is composed of a director and five faculty members representing the Main and Medical School campuses. Contributing divisions include the Schools of Science and Engineering, Liberal Arts, Medicine, Public Health and Tropical Medicine, and Primate Center. Faculty research programs are funded through grants competitively awarded by federal, state, and private agencies under four major themes: Memory and Cognition ; Neurodegenerative Disease, Neural Injury and Repair ; Hormone-Brain Interactions ; and Brain-Body Health . Doctoral students conduct cutting-edge research in modern laboratory environments that foster supportive instruction and intensive training in the neurosciences.  The Neuroscience Doctoral Program provides graduate students with a broad education in both the theoretical and applied aspects of basic research in the neurosciences. Through their coursework and research, students receive diversified training in neuroanatomy, neurophysiology, neuropharmacology, neuroendocrinology, molecular and cellular neurobiology, behavioral neuroscience, cognitive neuroscience, and research methods. In addition, students have opportunities to present and publish their research findings, and to gain experience in grant writing and teaching pedagogy. The objective of the Neuroscience Doctoral Program is to prepare graduate students for their future postdoctoral training and careers in academia, industry, and related professions. All students are guaranteed to receive financial support for five years as long as satisfactory and timely progress is made toward the degree. Financial support includes a full tuition waiver and a stipend paid every other week over twelve months of the year. Students are funded during their first two years by teaching assistantships.  After the first two years students are supported by research assistantships arranged though their major advisors in their permanent laboratories. Doctoral Degree Requirements The pursuit of the Ph.D. degree is a journey with five major milestones. (1) Students must successfully complete a curriculum consisting of core and elective courses taken during the first two years of study. (2) Students complete three rotations in different laboratories, each 6-8 weeks in duration, during the first year of study in order to identify a permanent laboratory.   (3) Students must pass written and oral components of a qualifying examination in the third year of study administered by the Doctoral Committees. (4) Students must prepare and defend a dissertation prospectus before their Doctoral Committees in the fourth year of study.  (5) Students must complete their dissertation research, prepare a written form of the dissertation, orally defend the dissertation, and receive approval from their Doctoral Committees as the final step toward earning the Ph.D. within five years. Required Course Work A minimum of 50 course credits are required for the Ph.D. in Neuroscience.

      "Paralegal Studies Post-Baccalaureate Certificate Overview Requirements The School of Professional Advancement's General Legal Studies Program was first approved by the American Bar Association’s (ABA) Standing Committee on Paralegals in 1981 and earned its most recent reapproval in 2023.  Throughout this time, the program has maintained compliance with the rigorous ABA guidelines that govern all aspects of our operations, providing our graduates with the  superior education that ABA requires and legal employers demand. The Paralegal Studies Post-Baccalaureate Certificate (PBC) is available for students who have completed a bachelor's degree from a regionally accredited institution, earning an overall GPA of at least 2.0. The 9-course, 27-credit curriculum for the Paralegal Studies PBC focuses upon legal office skills, ethics, and substantive law courses.  Most students finish the PBC and embark upon their new careers within one year.  Carefully sequenced coursework includes eight core skills classes that emphasize legal research, writing, ethics, and analysis, along with law office technology and other practical aspects of the legal profession. Upper-level electives allow students to explore important areas of substantive law. In or near the final semester, students not already employed in law offices take the practicum course, which includes a 100-hour internship in a legal services office and an instructional component focusing upon legal ethics, professionalism, and career success skills. GLSP courses are offered in person or online, in either synchronous remote (meeting one evening per week on Zoom) or fully online ( with at least two Zoom sessions that are recorded for those who cannot attend) formats .  Subject to the ABA requirement that each student complete at least 3 classes (9 credits) in person or in synchronous remote format, you may take your GLSP classes from wherever you may be , in the format that suits your needs and preferences . Many of our PBC graduates pursue careers as paralegals or in other positions in law firms, courts, corporations, government agencies, non-profit legal service providers, and other legal offices, while others enter law school and become attorneys. General Legal Studies Program mission statement: The General Legal Studies Program provides our students with the skills, wisdom, and integrity to create, communicate and conserve knowledge and to pursue careers as efficient, ethical legal professionals who are prepared to assist attorneys in courts, governmental agencies, law firms, and other legal services offices, or to apply to law school after graduation, if they choose. General Legal Studies Program Learning Outcomes On completion of the General Legal Studies Program curriculum, graduates will have the knowledge and skills to: Describe and analyze the differences among the jurisdictions and functions of the state and federal civil, criminal, and administrative court systems. Interpret and apply legal terminology. Describe the primary differences between the Louisiana Civil Law legal system and the common law legal system.

      "Major: Pharmacology, MS - Home Content\n",
      "Pharmacology, MS Overview Requirements One Year Masters Program A one year post-baccalaureate program leading to the MS degree in Pharmacology Designed for those interested in improving their credentials to gain admission to a medical or dental school Class size is maintained at less than 35 to create a more personal connection between students & faculty Students in our MS program take the School of Medicine's 2nd year Medical Pharmacology course (taught separately in a different sequence) All graduate courses are taught within the School of Medicine by full time Medical School faculty Successful performance will significantly improve ones credentials for applying to medical or dental school. Students who took the MCAT a second time after completing our MS program between 2009-2013 significantly increased their MCAT score by 3.5±1.8(n=47, P<0.0001) (based upon the pre-2015 MCAT scale of 3-45). Over the past 5 years 78.5% of pharmacology MS graduates have gained admittance into medical, dental or graduate school (113/144 students for classes graduating between 2013-2017). Objectives To train students in the principles underlying the discipline of pharmacology To learn the approach, rationale, and methods required to design and conduct research in pharmacology Tulane became the first national research institution to integrate public service into its core curriculum for undergraduates in 2006. Now, the entire university community, including the schools of Architecture, Business, Law, Liberal Arts, Medicine, Public Health and Tropical Medicine, Science and Engineering and Social Work – is committed to public service. Public service is of particular importance to those entering our one year masters program, because providing a track record of significant public or community service has become a prerequisite for admission to most US medical schools. Students are expected to move beyond the scope of academics and work in a community to improve the health of a population. This is \"what medicine is all about\". As a result, a core requirement of our Masters program in Pharmacology is that students provide public or community service averaging at least 1 hour per week, or 12 hours per semester. During the 2017-18 academic year, students in our pharmacology Master's program performed over 2167 hours of public service in the New Orleans area (with an average of 68 hours per student for the academic year). Tulane has a Center for Public Service that helps connect students with numerous community partners & outreach programs that are active in the New Orleans area. As a part of the pharmacology curriculum, students are required to document their service activities in short essays, posted photos or video clips, and reflect upon the learning garnered from such activities in an online blog or wiki page. In addition, students are also expected to reflect on what they have learned from their academic and classroom activities. Tulane is setting the standard for public service for the next generation of universities. When you receive a Tulane education, you will get a little something extra from community service activities that most other institutions don't offer. Our students get a unique educational experience that can be found Only in New Orleans. Only at Tulane. Non-Thesis Track: Historically most students have selected a non-thesis track. Students in this track are required to successfully complete a minimum of 30 credit hours of course work, including 4 elective courses (8 credit hours) in the Spring semester. Students can earn up to 32 credit hours for the year by signing up for 2 credit hours in the ePortfolio course during one semester. Thesis Track: Students are required to complete the requirements for a Master's thesis, and successfully complete a minimum of 26 credit hours of course work, plus a total of 4 credit hours of Pharmacology Masters Research (divided between Fall & Spring semesters), for a total of 30 credit hours. The thesis can be based on either laboratory or library research (the topic to be chosen by the student in consultation with the advisor and the thesis committee). Students can also earn up to 32 credit hours for the year by signing up for 2 credit hours in the ePortfolio course each semester. Students on the thesis track should also sign up for Masters Thesis Research (0 credit hours) which will be included on a student's Transcript as evidence of having written a Thesis. Community Service: A track record of community or public service has become a prerequisite for admission to most US medical schools. Students must complete a minimum of 1 hour of community service per week, or >12 hours per semester. Documentation & reflection on what students learn from community service activities is a component of the Pharmacology ePortfolio course. Students can also elect to perform 24 hours of community service in a semester for 2 credit hours in the ePortfolio course each semester. This can be used to complete 32 total credit hours at the end of the program.

      "Philosophy, MA Overview Requirements Tulane offers a terminal MA degree in Philosophy. The program is intended for students who are eager to continue their study of philosophy, but do not feel ready to enter a PhD program. The MA program can help students develop a deeper and more comprehensive understanding of both contemporary issues in philosophy as well as the history of philosophy, and to prepare to seek admission into a competitive PhD program. It is also useful for students who have a strong interest in philosophy, but are unsure about whether they would like to commit to pursuing a PhD. The philosophy department at Tulane offers a wide variety of courses, and is especially attractive for students wishing to pursue research in ethics, political philosophy, the history of philosophy, and philosophy of mind. For information about our faculty members, please see our faculty page . An undergraduate major in philosophy is desirable for graduate study in philosophy, but it is not essential. However, students admitted with insufficient background in ethics or logic or the history of philosophy may be required to take courses in these areas without graduate credit. Transfer course credit for previous graduate work in philosophy is possible. The terminal MA program is independent of the PhD program at Tulane. Subsequent admission to the PhD program at Tulane requires application through the normal channels. The program is intended to be completed within two years. For information about the terminal MA program at Tulane, please contact the Director of Graduate Studies, Kevin Morris . The 4+1 Masters Degree Program The Department also offers a program of study that allows Tulane undergraduates who graduate with a major in philosophy to receive an MA in Philosophy after one additional year. The program is intended primarily for students who are eager to continue their study of philosophy, yet either do not feel ready to apply for admission into a PhD program, or have no interest in doing so. The 4+1 program MA program helps students develop a deeper and more comprehensive understanding of both contemporary issues in philosophy as well as the history of philosophy, and to prepare to seek admission into a competitive PhD program. It is also useful for students who have a strong interest in philosophy, but are unsure about whether they would like to commit to pursuing a PhD.  The philosophy department at Tulane offers a wide.  A variety of courses, and is especially attractive for students wishing to pursue research in ethics, political philosophy, the history of philosophy, and philosophy of mind. For information about our faculty members, please see our faculty page.  The 4 + 1 MA program is independent of the PhD program. Subsequent admission to the PhD program requires application through the normal channels. The terminal MA Degree may be earned in one of two ways. 30 Credit hours total which includes satisfactory completion of 24 hours of coursework (8 courses) and submission and defense of a thesis (6 credits). This route is not intended for candidates for the PhD. Satisfactory completion of 30 hours of coursework (10 courses) and passing one qualifying paper. The 4+1 M.A. degree will be awarded to students who obtain either of the following: Passing grades in 30 credit hours of graduate level courses (i.e., 6000-level and 7000-level).     Passing grades in 24 credit hours of graduate level courses and a Master's thesis (6 credits).  The first option will be encouraged in most cases.  In order to satisfy either of these options, it will be necessary to carry over a number of courses from the undergraduate degree.  The requirements for the Philosophy Major in the B.A. degree include two courses at the 6000-level. ONE AND ONLY ONE of those courses can count toward the 4+1 M.A. requirements. However, any additional 6000-level or 7000-level courses that have been taken for the undergraduate degree may be transferred (UP TO A MAXIMUM OF 12 CREDIT HOURS).

      "Philosophy, PhD Overview Requirements An undergraduate major in Philosophy is desirable for graduate study in philosophy, but it is not essential. However, students admitted with insufficient background in ethics or logic or the history of philosophy will be required to take courses in these areas without graduate credit. Transfer course credit for previous graduate work in philosophy is possible. There are two tracks in the Ph.D. Program, the standard track and the specialty track in Moral Philosophy. The two tracks differ in the coursework requirements for them. Students may either take the standard Ph.D. track or the specialty Ph.D. track in moral philosophy, and may opt into or out of the specialty track at any time. The Ph.D. Degree (Standard track and Moral Philosophy track) has three components: Satisfactory completion of 48 hours (16 courses) of coursework in accordance with departmental distribution requirements (see below). Submission of one satisfactory Qualifying Paper. Students are subject to dismissal should the qualifying paper be deemed unacceptable. Presentation and defense of a Doctoral Thesis. Students in the PhD program must submit all materials for any incomplete class grades by September 1 of the following year. For example, materials for any incomplete from courses during the 2019-2020 academic year would have to be submitted by September 1, 2020. Students in the PhD program are subject to an annual review, described below. Deadlines for the Qualifying Paper and Dissertation Progress are described below. No student may miss a deadline without a strong excuse presented to the Director of Graduate Studies (such as a documented medical or family emergency). A failure to meet one of these deadlines is cause to bring the issue of the student’s performance before the department as a whole. Distribution Requirement for Coursework (Standard Track) The distribution requirement for coursework in the Standard track is as follows. Students must take at least one course in three of the following areas: Metaphysics Epistemology Philosophy of Mind Philosophy of Language Philosophy of Science In addition, students are required to take three courses in the history of philosophy (at least one in Ancient as well as one in Modern), one course in Moral/Political/Legal Philosophy and one in Logic. The distribution requirement in Logic may be waived if a student demonstrates graduate-level competence by passing an examination in this subject after joining the program. Of the remaining eight courses, two may be taken in another department, with approval of the Philosophy Department Graduate Studies Committee. Distribution Requirement for Coursework (Moral Philosophy Track) The distribution requirement for coursework in the specialty track in Moral Philosophy is as follows. Students must take at least one course in three of the following areas: Metaphysics Epistemology Philosophy of Mind Philosophy of Language Philosophy of Science In addition, students are required to take three courses in the history of philosophy (at least one being the History of Ethics or the History of Political Philosophy), and one in Formal Methods (which may include logic, game theory, rational choice theory, or another course in the methodological tools relevant to the student's philosophical work). The distribution requirement in Formal Methods may be waived if a student demonstrates graduate-level competence by passing an examination in this subject after joining the program. Of the remaining nine courses, six must be in moral and political philosophy, with at least one course each from four of the following subdisciplines: Political Philosophy Philosophy of Law Moral Psychology Agency and Responsibility Metaethics Normative Ethics Applied Ethics Feminist Ethics Two of these courses may be taken in another department, with approval of the Philosophy Department Graduate Studies Committee. Students in this track are also expected to attend and participate regularly in Murphy Institute seminars and lectures in moral philosophy. The Qualifying Paper Purpose of the Qualifying Paper The purpose of the project is to evaluate the student's ability to produce a \"professional\" quality paper. The paper may be the result of reworking a term paper from a course.Students are encouraged but not required to write the qualifying paper on the topic of their dissertation. The paper must represent new work written by the student. It is not allowed, for instance, simply to submit a previous MA thesis. Any old work must be substantially revised. Quality Students are subject to dismissal should the Qualifying Paper be deemed unacceptable. It is therefore important to approach the task of writing this paper with a sense of the quality of work that is expected and how this may be achieved. The qualifying paper should provide strong evidence that the student is willing and able to produce publishable work. An acceptable paper will demonstrate ability to engage your own philosophical thinking in relation to the relevant literature and competence with that literature. This might be achieved by: Presenting an argument dialectically among several writers and entering the discussion with your own view. Providing an illuminating account of a philosopher's argument(s) or contention(s) Interpreting a philosophic text in order to bring to light its argument or teaching Tracing the historical development of an idea that you analyze and evaluate It is not acceptable to: Simply review several books or articles on a given topic Present different philosopher's claims or arguments and merely opt for one of them. The Committee The Qualifying Paper is evaluated by a committee consisting of three faculty members. The Director will be a faculty member agreed upon by the student, the Director of Graduate Studies (DGS), and the faculty member. The Second and Third Reader on the Committee will be assigned by the DGS in consultation with the Director. The student is advised to make arrangements with the director of the paper about how the interchange between them shall work out as the composition of the paper progresses. Different professors may wish to do this in different ways. A general understanding between director and student should be reached before the summer vacation that precedes the year in which semester in which the paper is due. With the approval of the director, topics may be modified or changed. Deadlines The day two weeks before the last day of Spring semester classes is the target date for submitting a proposal for the Qualifying Paper to the DGS. For example, if the Qualifying Paper is due on October 1, 2019, the student should submit a proposal two weeks before the end of the Spring 2020 semester. The proposal should include a brief description of the project (at least several lines) and the name of the faculty member who has agreed to serve as director. The Qualifying Paper must be submitted by October 1 during the student's third year (or second year if the student entered with a transferable MA degree). It is expected that one or more drafts of the paper would have been submitted before the deadline and the final version would reflect responses to comments from members of the committee. Evaluation The members of the committee will evaluate the paper and independently submit to the DGS a judgment on it, with comments and justification for the judgment. Faculty must report grades for the Qualifying paper by November 15. The original submission will be evaluated as \"Pass,\" \"Fail,\" or \"Revise and Resubmit.\" Two \"Fail\" votes on the original submission results in a failed paper. Only one \"Revise and Resubmit\" or \"Fail\" vote is needed to force revisions, and in that case, the revised paper will be due on February 1. After that date a majority vote will decide whether the paper passes or fails. The final grade for the Qualifying Paper must be submitted by the faculty members by March 1. A failed paper will result in dismissal from the doctoral program, subject to a review by the whole department. The faculty committee members may not inform the student of his/her evaluation until the Director of Graduate Studies or the Philosophy Department faculty releases the information. The Dissertation Students should complete an \"Admission to Candidacy\" form to the DGS after completing all requirements but the dissertation. Students should seek a dissertation supervisor and in consultation with that professor form a committee with two other faculty members. Students must submit to the DGS the dissertation prospectus, along with a “Dissertation Prospectus Approval” form by October 1 of the 4th year (3rd year if the student entered with a transferable MA degree). Students must submit to the DGS a dissertation chapter that shows significant progress beyond the Qualifying Paper by February 1 of the 4th year (3rd year if the student entered with a transferable MA degree). Students must submit to the DGS an additional dissertation chapter that is different from the first one by February 1 of the 5th year (4th year if the student entered with a transferable MA degree). For more information about graduation requirements see the Dissertation Guidelines at the Tulane Graduate Studies website. Annual Review The Department will conduct an annual review at which faculty members review the progress of graduate students. The meeting will be held during the spring semester, typically around March 1, and at the meeting a warning might be issued to a student to either end funding or terminate a student from the program. A student will be automatically dismissed from the program, subject to a review by the whole department, if he or she failed the qualifying paper, has a preponderance of B grades (or lower), has two B- grades (or lower), or a C+ grade (or lower) in their classes. In addition, the department can vote to warn the student that funding will be terminated or the student will be dismissed from the program if – among other possible reasons – the student has three or more B grades (or lower), misses one of the deadlines stated above, has a weak qualifying paper, or shows insufficient progress in his or her dissertation. The department has to state the cause for concern in the warning letter, and after being warned, students would have a semester to markedly improve their performance as well as present any evidence that might put their performance in a different light. Without this, the initial department vote would take effect after the semester is over, and either the funding would be terminated, or the student would be dismissed from the program. Progress Requirements for Students Receiving External Fellowships Students on a fellowship or leave for a year must show substantial evidence of work they have completed. This would typically be two chapters of the dissertation, or one chapter along with papers for publication or presentation, which should be submitted to the dissertation Director and Graduate Director. Further support in the program, such as continuation of the graduate stipend or adjunct teaching, will depend on meeting this requirement.

Students should always confirm with the Major Advisor that all their electives are acceptable. Notes: Students are encouraged to consider a bachelor of science in physics as preparation for graduate study in disciplinary and interdisciplinary sciences (physics, astrophysics, biophysics, chemistry, neuroscience, materials science, geophysics, meteorology, oceanography, and applied physics), for professional study in medicine, patent law, business, or engineering, and for careers in environmental science, in mathematical or computer modeling, in science writing, or in science and public policy. Within the requirements above, programs can be tailored to suit the needs of students who elect these career options. In addition, the department offers a 4+1 program that allows students to obtain a Master's Degree in five years, by enabling them to take graduate level courses as an undergraduate. Tulane University is a member of the Oak Ridge Associated Universities (ORAU) consortium. Research opportunities are often available for undergraduate Physics majors in conjunction with faculty, on a case by case basis. Students are responsible for fulfilling all TIDES, cultural knowledge, foreign language, writing, service learning, and other requirements, required by Tulane and the School of Science and Engineering. Sample Schedule of Classes for Physics (This is only a suggested schedule and students should not feel compelled in any way to model their course of studies on this example. Many other options and alternatives are possible, especially when including a double major. Chemistry, for example, is not a requirement for the B.S. in Physics. The illustration of certain courses in certain semesters below does not guarantee they will be offered in the suggested semester.

      "Physics, MS Overview Requirements The Tulane 4+1 Program in Physics: Current Tulane undergraduates may earn an MS degree in physics by adding one year to the four years of study usually required for the BS degree. The MS degree provides a more complete preparation for a PhD program than the BS. The MS is usually preferred by industry and business. Normally an MS degree requires at least two years of postgraduate study. In this program the time is reduced to one year by taking some graduate level courses as an undergraduate. The MS requires 24 hours of physics coursework at the graduate (6000-7000) level plus six additional hours of either graduate courses or research. In the 4+1 program, a student will normally take a total of twelve hours of graduate courses as a junior or senior and nine more hours each semester in the fifth year. This provides a total of thirty hours, including up to six hours of research credit. With permission of the graduate advisor, graduate courses in other departments ( e.g. Chemistry, Computational Science, Math, Engineering) may count toward the MS. A 4+1 student should begin the program in their junior year. While it may be possible to complete the requirements for the 4+1 program by starting in the senior year, this is difficult and not recommended. Please note that some graduate courses are co-taught with similar undergraduate courses and have somewhat different requirements. Application: Application may be made using the standard form for graduate admission available on the SSE website ( https://sse.tulane.edu/academics/graduate/admissions ). Normally an undergraduate GPA of 3.0 or higher, overall and in physics courses, is required for admission. One letter of recommendation is required. The GRE is not required.\n",

      "Physics, PhD Overview Requirements The PhD degree in physics provides the academic foundation and laboratory training to conduct high quality research at the frontiers of physics. Graduate students from diverse backgrounds become creative physicists with the skills to thrive in educational, industrial or government laboratory settings. Course Work At least 48 credits of graduate courses must be completed. Required Courses Course List Course ID Title Credits PHYS 6010 Techniques Theor Phys I 3 PHYS 7060 Theoretical Mechanics 3 PHYS 7100 Statistical Mechanics 3 PHYS 7170 Quantum Mechanics I 3 PHYS 7180 Quantum Mechanics II 3 PHYS 7230 Electromagnetic Theory I 3 PHYS 7910 Research I 3 PHYS 7920 Research II 3 PHYS 7930 Research III 3 PHYS 7940 Research IV 3 Elective courses (18 credits): The remaining 18 credits should be graduate level physics electives, or graduate level courses in a related field with approval of the research supervisor and graduate program advisor. One of the electives must be a computational course (PHYS 6170 Computational Physics and Engineering, MPEN 6290 Computational Materials Science and Engineering, or a computational course in another department approved by the graduate program advisor). Up to 6 credits may be fulfilled by Advanced Research I and II, with approval of the research supervisor and graduate program advisor. Advanced Research I and II may be taken at the same time as Research I-IV, with up to 6 credits of research allowed in one semester. Grades Per the SSE Handbook: “A course in which a grade of C+ or less is earned cannot be counted toward a graduate degree. If a student receives one B- grade, the student is immediately considered for probation by the Associate Dean for Graduate Studies in consultation with the appropriate department/program. If a student receives two grades of B-, or one grade less than B-, during his/her tenure in the School of Science and Engineering, the student is placed on probation and considered for dismissal by the Associate Dean in consultation with the appropriate department/program.” A student who does not maintain the minimum 3.0 GPA in graduate course work will be subject to disenrollment. Written Qualifying Exam The Ph.D. qualifying exam is a 6-hour written examination covering classical and modern physics, given by the department once per semester. It covers the typical U.S. undergraduate physics curriculum with an emphasis on classical electrodynamics and quantum mechanics. The qualifying exam must be attempted no later than the fourth semester of graduate study. Students who are sufficiently prepared may take it during the first year with approval of the research supervisor. The passing score is 60%. Students who fail the qualifying exam must retake it until passed. Students may attempt the qualifying exam up to three times. Any student who has not passed the qualifying exam by the end of the fifth semester of graduate study will be disenrolled from the program. Students who have met course requirements and passed the qualifying exam may apply to become degree candidates. Faculty Dissertation Committee Prior to the prospectus defense, the student and research supervisor form the faculty dissertation committee, which consists of the research supervisor (chair) and at least two other faculty members. One member may be from another Tulane department or other appropriate institution. The faculty dissertation committee (henceforth the committee) examines the student at the prospectus defense and oral dissertation defense, and approves the final written dissertation. Prospectus Defense The prospectus defense demonstrates to the committee that the student has acquired sufficient knowledge in the specific research area and can effectively express that knowledge orally and in writing. A student must pass the written qualifying exam before undertaking the prospectus defense. The prospectus defense consists of a written proposal and an oral defense: The written research proposal (10-15 pages) contains an introduction, proposed research and justification, methods, preliminary results, and discussion. It must be reviewed and approved by the committee before the end of the sixth semester of graduate study. The oral defense is a two-hour oral examination, including a research presentation (about 45 minutes) prepared by the student, given by the committee. The examination includes specific questions about the student's research as well as broadly focused questions on the general area of research. The oral defense must be attempted following approval of the written proposal, no later than the sixth semester of graduate study. If failed, the student is normally given a second attempt in the following semester. After two failures the student will be disenrolled from the program (exceptions due to extenuating circumstances may be granted by vote of the faculty). Students who are sufficiently prepared are strongly encouraged to take the prospectus defense before the end of the 4th semester of graduate study. It is expected that, after completion of the oral prospectus defense, the Ph.D. candidate will obtain a Research Assistantship (RA) in the same research group. In order to encourage this, the faculty have adopted a policy for allocating graduate students on TA's to research groups. Annual Report In April of each year, every Ph.D. student will submit a brief annual progress report (1-2 pages) to the research supervisor (and committee, when formed) summarizing research progress and accomplishments over the previous year, and future plans and milestones. This requirement is waived in the years when the prospectus and thesis defenses are completed. Dissertation The final requirement for the Ph.D. degree is a written dissertation based on original research, approved by the committee, and its defense in an oral exam by the committee. Master's Degree The master's degree is not a requirement for the Ph.D. in physics. Admission with financial aid is only for doctoral students. However a graduate student may receive an M.S. in Physics based on 30 hours of approved graduate credit, or (if the research supervisor agrees to offer this option) an M.S. in Physics based on 24 hours of approved graduate credit plus a thesis deemed acceptable by the research supervisor. Research course credit does not count toward the M.S. in Physics degree. Program Transfers Students in the Physics Ph.D. program cannot transfer to the Materials Physics and Engineering Ph.D. program without going through the regular admissions process. Exceptions to the requirements, due to extenuating circumstances, may be granted by vote of the PEP faculty. The Physics program requirements were last modified in Fall 2018. The requirements for students matriculating prior to Fall 2018 may be found here .\n",

      "Policy Economics, MA Overview Requirements The Master of Arts in Policy Economics at Tulane University integrates economic analysis and quantitative methods in a program of study designed for practitioners. Successful students will be prepared to enter the job market with a set of analytical skills designed for economic policy analysis. Whereas a Ph.D. in economics is a research degree, the M.A. in Policy Economics provides a curriculum of applied analysis and quantitative techniques better suited for the practitioner of economics. This program provides students with a deep and broad exposure to the analytical methods of modern economics that can be applied to policy settings, without requiring the advanced mathematics training that is only essential to academic researchers. The program builds on the strengths of the bachelor's degrees in Economics at Tulane by increasing the required number of economics courses and expanding their rigor and depth. In courses offered jointly with the undergraduates, M.A. students are held to higher academic standards and are generally assigned supplementary research work. Successful students can expect to complete at least seven applied projects in the course of earning the M.A. degree. Masters Program Sample Course Schedule Internal Applicants (4 + 1) Internal applicants (4 + 1) must must satisfy all remaining bachelor's degree requirements in their senior year in the undergraduate program. In satisfying these requirements, they may take at most 4 6000-level courses in economics (12 credit hours) that will also count towards the degree of M.A. in Policy Economics. The remaining 24 credit hours must be taken after graduation from their undergraduate program.

      "Political Economy Major with Concentration in Economics and Public Policy Overview Requirements Tulane University’s most popular and acclaimed multidisciplinary major, the Political Economy major aims to promote sustained reflection on the multiple connections between political and economic activities and institutions. The Political Economy major supports and promotes Tulane University’s mission to create, communicate and conserve knowledge in order to enrich the capacity of individuals, organizations and communities to think, to learn, to act and to lead with integrity and wisdom. The political economy major aims to promote sustained reflection on the interrelations of political and economic activities and institutions. It provides undergraduate students with the basic skills of economic analysis. The major is also based firmly on the view that the study of the interrelations of politics and economics has a rich humanistic tradition and that its pursuit can encourage sustained reflection on fundamental values. Political economy is a multidisciplinary major built on a core of eight required courses and five elective courses drawn from economics, political science, history and philosophy. This major is designed to avoid the sometimes excessive specialization that characterizes more traditional undergraduate majors. While providing students basic skills of economic analysis, the political economy major at Tulane is distinctively based on the view that technical economic analysis should not be divorced from a broader concern for understanding the moral and historical foundations of economic institutions and political structures. Internship Grants and Senior Thesis In the summer between junior and senior years, a political economy major may elect to participate in a summer internship. The Murphy Institute offers a limited number of grants in an open competition for political economy majors only. With consent of the Associate Director, a student may pursue a degree with honors in political economy. A senior honors thesis is required.

Only students admitted to the PhD program in Political Science may pursue the MA in Political Science. Political science has a rich history at Tulane, which is where the American Political Science Association was founded in 1903. Today, our MA program prepares students to ask innovative questions, conduct independent research, and become effective teachers. In training students, we emphasize the importance of mastering methodology and research design and using those tools to analyze how political phenomena develop around the world. Our faculty has broad expertise – the department consists of scholars who study domestic and international politics, in relation to the United States and the countries of Latin America, Africa, Europe, and Asia. The substantive concerns that motivate the research of our faculty and students consist of the politics of inclusion and exclusion; the consequences of inequality; obstacles to sustainable development; international trade, cooperation, and conflict; the protection of human rights; and the foundations of durable authoritarianism. Those thematic research foci intersect in multiple ways and jointly contribute to informing our understanding of some of the most pressing global concerns of our times. The department is methodologically diverse and inclusive of different approaches to the study of politics.

In training students, we emphasize the importance of mastering methodology and research design and using those tools to analyze how political phenomena develop around the world. Our faculty has broad expertise – the department consists of scholars who study domestic and international politics, in relation to the United States and the countries of Latin America, Africa, Europe, and Asia. The substantive concerns that motivate the research of our faculty and students consist of the politics of inclusion and exclusion; the consequences of inequality; obstacles to sustainable development; international trade, cooperation, and conflict; the protection of human rights; and the foundations of durable authoritarianism. Those thematic research foci intersect in multiple ways and jointly contribute to informing our understanding of some of the most pressing global concerns of our times. The department is methodologically diverse and inclusive of different approaches to the study of politics. The PhD requirements include 48 credits of coursework; passing comprehensive exams; developing a dissertation prospectus; and defending a dissertation. The 48 credits of required coursework are to be distributed as follows: Course List Course ID Title Credits Required POLS Courses 15 POLS 7111 Scope & Methods for Poli Sci POLS 7112 Quantitative Methods I POLS 7113 Quantitative Methods II POLS 7114 Qualitative Methods POLS 7116 Graduate Professional Skills One Course in American Politics or Theory 3 Field Seminars 6 POLS 7752 Special Topics POLS 7910 Research Five 6000 or 7000 Level POLS Electives 15 At Least Two Courses in Field 1 (Comparative or IR) Two Courses in Field 2 (Comparative or IR) No More Than Three Electives Outside POLS 1 9 Attendance at POLS Seminar for One Year 0 Dissertation Research POLS 9990 Dissertation Research Total Credit Hours 48 1 Language courses may be taken only with the approval of the Director of Graduate Studies. Exams During their fifth semester, students will take qualifying exams in the two areas of substantive concentration, one in their first field and another in their second field or in Methods. The first field can be either Comparative Politics (with International Relations being the second field) or International Relations (with Comparative Politics being the second field). Exams will be written and by the end of the sixth semester both exams must be passed. Teaching During their graduate training, students may be required to teach for at least two semesters, at least one of which will be an introductory course in Comparative Politics, International Relations, or Scope and Methods. Dissertation Dissertation committees will include three or, at most, four professors, with a chairperson from Political Science. With the approval of the committee chair, student may add one member outside of the Political Science Department (or outside Tulane). Students are required to take the Professional Skills Seminar and to begin dissertation prospectus preparation during their fifth semester; and, by the end of their third year, students will present a written prospectus for dissertation research and conduct an oral defense before their committee. On defending their prospectus, students will advance to candidacy, and will have three years in which to complete their dissertation.\n",

      "Political Science/ International Development Major Overview Requirements PSDV is the most inter-disciplinary Political Science major track. It focuses on the analysis of unequal political, social, and economic development around the world and what might be done to improve the livelihoods of people in the Global South as well as underprivileged communities in the United States. This track offers students an education firmly rooted in a social science framework that allows them to explore multiple meanings of international development. Coursework within the department introduces students to the history, theories, and methods of the field, allows them to deepen their knowledge of at least one world area (Latin America, Africa, Middle East, or Asia), and offers in-depth study of policy areas including poverty, migration, human rights, transitional justice, gender, foreign aid, food and agriculture, health, and environmental sustainability. Majors are required to complete one level beyond minimum proficiency in a language other than English, as well as introductory macroeconomics and international political economy courses. In recognition of the interdisciplinary nature of international development, majors and minors must complete electives in other departments. Choices include courses in Anthropology, Architecture, Asian Studies, Communication, Evolutionary Biology, Earth Science, Economics, History, Philosophy, Public Health, Sociology, Social Work, and Theatre. The Department of Political Science strongly recommends that PSDV students take advantage of at least one study abroad opportunity while at Tulane. We also encourage students to seek relevant internship opportunities inside and outside of the United States. This major prepares students to compete for Fulbright grants, study for professional and graduate degrees, and work for the U.S. government, international organizations, NGOs, foundations, and private firms.

      "River-Coastal Science and Engineering Certificate (Graduate) Overview Requirements Tulane University and the U.S. Army Engineer Corps of Engineers have partnered to provide a unique, graduate-level certificate program that focuses on teaching students both the science and engineering associated with river management. There is an emphasis on the academic underpinnings as well as pragmatic applications, and the interdisciplinary nature of rivers is stressed by including faculty who work in geology, civil engineering, geomorphology, river mechanics and engineering, biogeochemistry, ecology and numerical modeling. This program is offered fully online, combining self-taught modules with weekly Live Sessions and is available to students everywhere. This certificate program can, but does not have to, serve as a step toward a graduate degree in the subject. The River-Coastal Science and Engineering Certificate program will consist of the completion of one required course, RCSE 6800 Intro to River Science & Eng (3 c.h.) , or RCSE 6802 Introduction to Coastal Science and Engineering (3 c.h.) with at least four additional advanced courses listed below. The existing coursework in the program is: Course List Course ID Title Credits RCSE 6010 Water Resources Engineering II (offered Fall semester, odd years) 3 RCSE 6030 Water Resources Engineering III (offered Spring semester, even years) 3 RCSE 6040 Coastal Marine Geology (offered Fall semester, odd years) 3 RCSE 6660 Special Topics (Offered periodically) 1-3 RCSE 6710 Open Channel Flow (offered Spring semester, odd years) 3 RCSE 6800 Intro to River Science & Eng (offered every Spring semester) 3 RCSE 6802 Introduction to Coastal Science and Engineering (offered every Fall semester) 3 RCSE 6810 River and Stream Restoration (offered Spring semester, even years) 3 RCSE 6820 Introduction to River-Coastal Hydrologic and Hydraulic Modeling (offered Spring semester, even years) 3 RCSE 6830 River Mechanics & Management (offered Fall semester, even years) 3 RCSE 6840 Methods in River Sampling (offered Spring semester, odd years) 3 RCSE 6850 Estuarine Processes (offered Spring semester, odd years) 3 RCSE 6860 Environmental Data Analysis in the Anthropocene (offered Spring semester, even years) 3 RCSE 6865 Sea Level Rise (offered Spring semester, odd years) 3 RCSE 6870 Hydroclimatology (offered Fall semester, odd years) 3 RCSE 6875 Ecohydrology (offered Fall, even years) 3 RCSE 7100 Seminar in River Coastal Science and Engineering (Every semester) 1 RCSE 6900 Independent Study (Every semester) 1-3 Students should complete the Intro courses prior to enrolling in advanced courses unless permission is obtained from the River Science and Engineering Certificate program coordinator, Barb Kleiss (bkleiss @tulane.edu ) and the class instructor.  This exception will be made for students who are not initially interested in completing the full certificate program and that also meet the instructor’s prerequisites for entrance into the course.

      "River-Coastal Science and Engineering, MS (Non-Residential) Overview Requirements The River-Coastal Science and Engineering program is an effort by faculty and students to understand a key component of the Earth system—the linked environments of river basins, deltaic river mouths, and coastal ocean systems.  Much of our focus surrounds the nexus issue of water:  water exerts a strong control over landform evolution and ecosystem health, and is a priority human need for agriculture, industry, and health. This 30 credit degree for non-residential students is designed to allow professionals to acquire the degree remotely while employed.  Non-residential students may elect the thesis pathway (24 hours of classroom credit + 6 research credits) described in the residential Masters description or have the option to complete 30 credit hours of coursework. There is the opportunity in the non-thesis track to undertake a smaller-scale research project while enrolled in RCSE 6900 Independent Study.  Either non-residential pathway can be taken on a part-time or full-time (+9 credit hours per semester) basis.  We envision that most students who pursue this degree will have acquired the Graduate Certificate as an intermediate step, which provides an opportunity for the student to arrange their funding through their employer and to potentially conceive a research project they would conduct after becoming degree seeking that fits their individual work-life issues. All students must complete 30 graduate credit hours in order to obtain the degree. M.S. students can transfer up to 12 credit hours from previous graduate-level coursework to the degree. The RCSE Graduate Advisor and Department Chair must approve all transfer credits. Students hoping to transfer graduate credits should prepare and submit the paperwork at the start of their second semester at Tulane. SSE will only transfer credits when the student has completed one semester (it is at that point that a Tulane transcript is available). Academic graduate electives from other departments may be applied to the degree up to a limit of 9 credit hours.  All other courses must originate from RCSE.  If a class is not on the approved list, a student may petition the Graduate Advisor for it to be accepted as an elective. Note that thesis MS students typically do NOT register for any credits over the summer (Ph.D. students must due to health insurance reasons, but not MS students). Unless students have been exposed previously to the material offered, students are strongly encouraged to take two introductory technical courses offered by the RCSE, RCSE 6800 Intro to River Science & Eng (3 c.h.) and RCSE 6802 Intro to Coastal Science and Engineering.

The resident MS degree program is a 2-year program, in which a student will take 24 graduate credit hours of coursework and write a thesis (6 research credits). Alternately, students may pursue a non-thesis pathway that requires 30 classroom credits and has the option of conducting a smaller-scale research project through RCSE 6900 Independent Study. The program is well suited as a stepping stone to students considering pursuing a Ph.D. degree programs at Tulane or elsewhere in this discipline or related areas. The program is also useful for students planning to enter more advanced professional degree programs (e.g., law, public health, business, natural resources management, etc.). It can be useful for students interested in seeking employment with environmental agencies of federal, state, and municipal government; non-governmental organizations; education; and in private industry, including environmental consulting firms.

Tulane requires 48 credit hours of graduate coursework (typically comprised of 16 courses each carrying 3 credit hours) over the course of four semesters as part of the Ph.D. requirements. For students entering with a Master’s degree, the RCSE graduate committee may approve up to 24 credits of graduate coursework toward the Ph.D. total—this classwork can be earned in SSE or externally.  To maintain maximum flexibility in tailoring an interdisciplinary program to the RCSE Ph.D. student, required coursework will be limited to research and writing skill augmentation, as well as typical registration (e.g., dissertation research) required when a student reaches candidacy. To support this tailored program and to rapidly transition decision-making away from the RCSE graduate committee in these matters, we have chosen to institute a very early dissertation committee composition (end of the first semester of matriculation). The Ph.D. student will be required to submit a full program of study (including classwork) approved by their dissertation committee to the RCSE graduate committee by the end of the 2nd full semester of matriculation. PhD students can transfer up to 24 credit hours from previous graduate-level coursework to the degree. The RCSE Graduate Advisor and Department Chair must approve all transfer credits. Students hoping to transfer graduate credits should prepare and submit the paperwork at the start of their second semester at Tulane. SSE will only transfer credits when the student has completed one semester (it is at that point that a Tulane transcript is available). RCSE Ph.D. students will be anticipated to be supported through fellowship, scholarship, or other of the various kinds of assistantships.  Hence, they will be required under SSE rules to be registered for at least nine hours of graduate credit until admitted to candidacy to maintain full-time residence status. These nine hours of graduate credit, following SSE standards, may be a combination of course work and research or solely research credit. Approved academic graduate electives from other departments can be applied to the degree up to a limit of 12 credit hours.  All other courses must originate from RCSE.  If a class is not on the approved list, a student may petition the Graduate Advisor for it to be accepted as an elective. Note that Ph.D. students must register for credits during the summer due to health insurance reasons Unless students have been exposed previously to the material offered, thesis committees will strongly urge students to take two introductory technical course offered by RCSE—the existing RCSE 6800 Introduction to River Science and Engineering, and RCSE 6802 Introduction to Coastal Science and Engineering.

Note that if all other credit requirements are met, the student can enroll in ONLY 3 hrs of Masters Research to maintain enrollment, i.e. this maintains full time enrollment. PhD students must undertake a general (preliminary or qualifying) examination by the beginning of the third academic year of study (5 th semester).  Following SSE guidelines, a student who fails to take the test within a reasonable length of time will be judged not to be making adequate progress towards the degree and will be advised by RCSE not to continue graduate study.  Prior to scheduling the examination, the student will give an in person preliminary dissertation prospectus presentation to their committee where they outline the proposed topic of original research, a background of the state of knowledge of the topic, and the progress to date in their work. Following successful completion of the oral qualifying examination, the student will prepare a dissertation prospectus that focuses on the individual novel research projects that will result in dissertation chapters and eventual peer-reviewed publications. This document will be approved by the dissertation committee for submission to SSE, at which point the student will be advanced to candidacy.  Preliminary drafts of this prospectus will be produced in the required RCSE 7020 Technical Writing course. At the time of submission of dissertation for approval by the committee, a Ph.D. student will be required to have submitted at least one, and preferably two manuscripts for peer-reviewed publication as supervised by their dissertation committee.\n",

      "Theatre Design and Production, MFA Overview Requirements The Master of Fine Arts degree in Design at Tulane University offers an in-depth study of theatrical design areas with an emphasis on preparing the student for a career in the professional theatre or as a teacher of a specialized field at the university level. Applicants to the program must have completed an undergraduate degree in theatre or have had equivalent training and experience. The Master of Fine Arts degree in Design places concentration and emphasis on design as a collaborative process with equal emphasis on technical and creative skills as learned both through classwork and practical production. The program is a three-year program. Two and a half years are spent in residence and one semester of the third year in an internship with a professional theatre. Students with an MA in design or production may, at the discretion of the faculty, complete their degree sooner. Normally, 48 hours of course work are required for completion of the degree. In addition, twelve hours are earned with the internship assignment and a thesis production. It is the philosophy of the design faculty that the design process is best taught through the realization of designs in actual production situations. Each year, the Department of Theatre and Dance provides a number of opportunities for such realized design projects. The department produces three to four mainstage productions and one dance concert each year directed by faculty or guest directors. Students in design and technical direction are assigned to these projects as their skills develop. The Third Year Thesis Project becomes the culmination of a number of realized projects. The selection of this production is intended to provide a showcase of each student's talents and skill. Each student's work is reviewed by the faculty on a semester-to-semester basis. Admission Admission to the MFA Design program is highly selective and only a small number of candidates are selected every other year. This ensures each student considerable production experience as well as continual one-on-one contact with Theatre Design faculty. Prospective applicants are referred to the Graduate Program in the School of Liberal Arts for application materials and a catalog outlining further requirements and deadlines. Please note that while the university states a February 1 application deadline, the department extends its deadline past that date as we traditionally recruit at USITT in March. Admission to the program is based primarily on consideration of the candidate's academic ability as evidenced by his/her undergraduate GPA, previous theatre experience, and portfolio. The GRE is no longer required. Ideally, the design faculty would like the opportunity to look at the applicant's portfolio during an interview. However, if an interview is not possible, the department will request that the applicant send a portfolio of representative work for review. Please do not send your portfolio with your application; wait until it is requested by the department. Areas of Specialization Tulane University Theatre Department offers Scene Design, Costume Design, Lighting Design, and Technical Direction as areas of specialization within the framework of the Master of Fine Arts Degree. An MFA in Design candidate must select one of these areas of concentration and is urged to select a secondary area of specialization as well. An MFA student is required to take all courses stipulated as core courses for a major in design. In addition, a sequence in the area of specialization (listed below under electives) is required. If a secondary area of specialization is also elected, six units in that area, from the elective list, are required. Whenever possible, the design faculty utilizes class time as an opportunity to supervise closely the work of a student who is holding a design assignment in a given semester. For instance, if a student is enrolled in Costume Design and is also designing costumes for a production in the same semester, the design assignment will be substituted for one or more design projects. Reviews At the end of each semester, design students are required to attend the design gallery and an individual MFA review with the faculty. In the gallery, the student presents a record of his or her most representative work in the program and should be prepared to answer questions regarding that work. These reviews provide the all of faculty with the chance to see the work of individual students and exchange ideas and commentary on the student's progress. During their reviews, in additon to reviewing their work, students have an opportunity to voice their needs for further development within the program. The end of the semester review is intended as a positive meeting for evaluation and discussion of a student's work. If, however, a student's work (or attitude) is evaluated as undesirable or sub-standard, the student may be placed on probationary status the following semester. If the quality of the student's work has not improved by the end of the probationary semester, the student will be asked to leave the program. In some cases where either a student's work, attitude, or grades are deemed so unsatisfactory that their continuation in the program would be of no benefit to either them or the department, dismissal may be considered, in consultation with the Dean of the School of Liberal Arts. The student will be notified of his or her status in written form following their review each semester. Production Assistantships/Stipends Tulane University requires that each graduate student commit 15-20 hours a week of service to the department in which the student is involved. This is required of a student regardless of acceptance or non-acceptance of a stipend. Any student offered an assistantship will be granted a full tuition waiver.  Currently, all of our graduate students receive a stipend and a full tuition waiver. Professional Internships The program recommends that all MFA candidates in Design or Technical Production spend one semester of their third year as an intern in a professional theatre. This gives the student an opportunity to apply, in a purely production environment, the educational experiences of the first two years of graduate training. Further, it provides employment contacts which should be invaluable upon completion of the MFA. During the internship, the University continues to provide the graduate stipend. While the choice of theatre and arrangements for the position are primarily the responsibility of the student, the student’s faculty advisor makes every effort to aid in finding a satisfactory position. Design Options In addition to the departmental productions, there are a number of other opportunities for design open to graduate students that the design faculty encourages its students to explore. Operated in conjunction with the Department of Theatre and Dance at Tulane University, The New Orleans Shakespeare Festival at Tulane is a professional resident theater company with a summer repertory. Students in the graduate programs of Design and Technical Production are encouraged to spend at least one summer on staff, and are given some consideration in the technical and design positions available. There are other opportunities both on and off campus. The required credits for a Design Major is 60 hours.

The courses for which the student will serve as a TA must be approved by the faculty advisor. SPHL 9970 – Dissertation Research Doctoral students who have completed required doctoral course work but have not defended their prospectus are required to register for (SPHL 9970) Dissertation Research each semester to maintain continuous registration in the PhD program. SPHL 9990 – Dissertation Doctoral candidates who have defended their prospectus and are engaged in research are required to register for (SPHL 9990) Dissertation each semester until the degree is awarded. Comprehensive Exam Upon completion of required coursework, students are expected to develop a research question outside of the focus of their dissertation work and write and defend their work orally before a faculty committee chosen in consultation with the PhD Program Director. The purpose of the comprehensive examination is to ensure that candidates for the PhD degree can organize a clear plan of research around a problem different from their proposed thesis. Prospectus After passing the comprehensive exam the student along with their advisor will choose a prospectus dissertation committee and prepare and defend a prospectus of proposed research, ideally within 6 months after successful completion of the comprehensive examination. The committee must include a minimum of three members with at least two faculty from the Department of Tropical Medicine and one external to SPHTM. The research prospectus must be presented and defended at least one semester before the dissertation defense. Following the successful defense of the prospectus, students are admitted to PhD candidacy and proceed with dissertation research. Dissertation Students must conduct original public health research and defend a dissertation based on that research. The dissertation research demonstrates scholarly work and is the basis for the dissertation. The dissertation committee and SPHTM Executive Faculty approve the dissertation. In addition to SPHTM dissertation requirements for the PhD, the dissertation must meet the requirements for a PhD dissertation in Tropical Medicine.

      "The Interdisciplinary Ph.D. Program in Aging Studies is comprised of graduate students and faculty from eight schools at Tulane University and includes the Schools of Science and Engineering, Medicine, Public Health and Tropical Medicine, Liberal Arts, Social Work, Business, Law, and Architecture. The curriculum is designed to prepare students for successful careers in existing and emerging fields related to aging. Core courses include a two-semester Introductory Seminar on Aging, Topics in Aging Research, a biomedical course, a psychosocial course, and two semesters of research methods. Students also take specialized elective courses, while performing research, beginning in the first year of the Program. All course work is completed in two years, allowing the students to concentrate full time on research from their third year on. Each student is guided closely by an academic advisor and co-advisor to facilitate integration across disciplinary domains, and by a dissertation committee. To obtain the Ph.D., each student passes a written preliminary examination following completion of course work at which time the student advances to candidacy for the Ph.D. degree. Students prepare a dissertation research proposal, under guidance of the dissertation committee, then submit and defend orally a dissertation based on their own original research contribution to the field. Distribution Requirements Students will complete the general sequence of studies under the guidance of the program advisor and program committee recommendations. 24 graduate credits in aging-associated core and elective courses 6 graduate credits in research methods/statistics 6 credits in the Introductory Seminar (Proseminar) during the first year of study 6 credits in the program seminar course during the first through third years or until advancement to Candidacy 3 to 6 credits of internship At least two semesters of dissertation research Credits in Aging Seminar are required through Year Three and thereafter until advancement to Candidacy and registration for Dissertation Research Typical Schedule during Years One to Three Plan of Study Grid Year 1 Fall Credit Hours Proseminar in Aging 3 Psychosocial Core Course 3 Biomedical Core Course 3 Research Methods/Statistics 3 Research Topics in Aging 1 Aging Seminar 1 Credit Hours 14 Spring Proseminar in Aging 3 Biomedical Domain Elective 3 Psychosocial Domain Elective 3 Research Methods/Statistics 3 Research Topics in Aging 1 Aging Seminar 1 Credit Hours 14 Year 2 Fall Biomedical Domain Elective 3 Psychosocial Domain Elective 3 Independent Study/Research 1-6 Aging Seminar 1 Advanced Statistics (optional) Credit Hours 8-13 Spring Biomedical or Psychosocial Domain Electives 6 Independent Study/Research 1-6 Aging Seminar 1 Advanced Statistics (optional) Credit Hours 8-13 Year 3 Fall Independent Study/Research 1-6 Internship 3-6 Aging Seminar 1 Credit Hours 5-13 Spring Dissertation Research Aging Seminar 1 Credit Hours 1 Total Credit Hours 50-68 In addition, students are required to take an approved course in Responsible Conduct of Research (RCR). Several such courses are offered at Tulane. (See Vice President for Research website.) The course offered through the Office of Research consists of about six lectures and offers a certificate of completion. A similar course is offered for credit by the Master’s in Clinical Research Program at the School of Medicine. There is also an online CITI course (See Vice President for Research website.) Students must complete one of these courses before the end of the second year. Documentation of completion must be provided to the program office. Ideally, this course is taken in the fall semester of the second year. All students are expected to regularly attend the activities included in the Seminar (AGST 7100), even though credit is not awarded after the third year or after advancement to Candidacy, whichever is later. This includes presentations of their work-in-progress. The Program Office schedules students for their work-in-progress seminars throughout the year, and each student must present at least once each year to remain in good standing in the program. These presentations and presence of all students at the work-in-progress seminars is mandatory. Graduate work is a full-time effort. The number of credit hours does not indicate the amount of time that the student devotes to this effort. Students are required to spend all of their time outside the classroom to study/research.\n",

Distribution requirements call for art history MA students to take at least one class in each of the following three areas: 1) art of Ancient and Medieval Europe and Asia, the Pre-Columbian Americas; 2) art of Renaissance, Baroque, and 18th-c. Europe, Early Modern Asia, the Colonial Americas; 3) modern art of Europe, Asia, and the Americas, especially the U.S., Caribbean, Latin America, and the African diaspora. Students are also expected to take three classes with the regular faculty teaching in the area that most closely relates to their own research, and who will most likely be on their thesis committee. The 7000-level courses are for graduate students only and are sometimes taught in tandem with 3000-level courses for undergraduates. The 6000-level courses are taken by juniors and seniors as well as graduate students. Both include seminars on special topics. With the permission of their graduate advisor, students may take two courses outside the art history program. Language Requirement: Reading proficiency in at least one foreign language relevant to the student's work is required. French, German, Italian, Latin, and Spanish are especially useful for research in art history. The requirement is satisfied by passing a reading exam. Because reading knowledge of foreign languages is necessary for research in most art-historical fields, students are urged to take their language exam early. Thesis: An important step in the MA program is the writing of a thesis and its subsequent oral defense. The thesis may be the outgrowth of a seminar paper, or it may focus on a special interest of the student insofar as it falls within the area of competency of the faculty. Students work with their graduate advisors in selecting the appropriate topic, establishing the three-member thesis committee, and preparing the thesis prospectus by the end of the first year. One member of the thesis committee may be from another department or school in the university. While moderate in length and considerably more limited in scope than a doctoral dissertation, the MA thesis should demonstrate the student's ability to do research of publishable quality. The defense usually takes place a month before the end of the last semester.\n",

      "Curriculum Pre-Program In the months immediately before the EMBA curriculum begins, prep courses in accounting and quantitative skills help to align student skills with the requirements of the early courses in the curriculum. The subsequent orientation and team building sessions will familiarize new students with policies and procedures, and introduce faculty, classmates, and study teams. Intensive Weeks The EMBA program begins in January with a week-long session, Intensive Week I. Students complete two courses, including exams, in this eight-day intensive. Here students are reintroduced to academic life and begin to practice time management, balancing work, home, and school responsibilities. A multicultural intensive week is held on the New Orleans campus in January of the second year. During this Intensive Week II, students form new global study teams, collaborating and sharing a classroom with their EMBA counterparts from partner universities in Asia, Europe and Latin America. Alternate Weekends After Intensive Week I, classes transition to an alternate weekend structure, where students attend classes on Fridays and Saturdays on alternate weekends. Each set of two courses, a module, is typically completed in seven weeks. Electives In the second half of the curriculum, elective courses are introduced. Students can earn finance or management concentrations by selecting the elective course tracks in those areas. International Seminar The international business seminar abroad brings a global depth to the program, giving students firsthand knowledge of global business and management practices and focusing on the strategic and operational issues of doing business abroad. Today's markets and their economic interdependence demand that managers understand global strategic imperatives. This essential management knowledge makes the international business experience a critical and required component of the EMBA curriculum. During the international seminar, students: Explore the economic, technological, and political environments that influence global business initiatives and discover global business opportunities specific to the host country. Develop a keen understanding of global business challenges and management strategies for meeting those challenges. Gain firsthand knowledge of global business culture and practice through face-to-face interaction with international business leaders. Learn the specific challenges these companies face and the strategies employed to meet these challenges. Work directly with local organizations to solve real business problems. For the seminar, we handle all academic and logistical planning, including airfare, ground transportation, logistics, accommodations, group meals and company visits. These seminar costs are included in the total program cost. The seminar destination is usually determined eight to twelve months in advance. In past years, seminars have been held in Beijing, Cape Town and Paris, each presenting students a distinct and culturally unique business environment.

      "Curriculum General Requirements Students earning the finance and financial accounting concentration of the Freeman School's Doctor of Philosophy in Business Administration degree are required to take a minimum of 48 credits. These credits include required coursework in the first two years of the program, a third-year paper, some elective choices and some independent research credits in subsequent years. Econometrics Comprehensive Exam In the summer after the first year, students will be required to take and pass the comprehensive exam in econometrics (to be administered and graded by the Department of Economics, with the passing grade determined by the tenure system Finance/Financial Accounting faculty). First-Year Paper In the summer after the first year, students will also be required to complete a replication of an empirical paper in finance or financial accounting. The paper assignment will be the principal requirement of a for-credit course and should be completed by the end of the summer term. Alternatively, students may work as a co-author with a tenure system faculty member, who along with a second tenure-track faculty member will certify that the student has met the requirements for the first-year paper in the joint work. Co-authoring arrangements will be based on voluntary agreements between students and faculty members, without any a priori guarantee or compulsion. Major Area Comprehensive Exam In the summer after the second year, students will be required to take and pass the comprehensive exam in finance. Third-Year Paper Starting in the summer after the second year (or earlier), students will be required to work on an independent research project in finance or financial accounting. This project should result in a paper and is to be completed under the supervision of an appropriate faculty committee approved by the program director. The student must complete and successfully present the paper to the finance and financial accounting faculty for advancement in the program. The final paper should be completed and presented by the end of the spring semester of the third year. The presentation will be considered an oral examination. Students successfully passing this examination will be admitted into candidacy. Dissertation Proposal and Defense After entering candidacy, students will be expected to actively pursue dissertation research. Finance Seminars/Workshops Students are required to attend finance/financial accounting workshops and seminars unless they have a class conflict or an emergency. They are also encouraged to attend seminars in the economics department. Scholarships, Assistantships and Teaching Requirements Students will be granted assistantships and scholarships for up to six years. The scholarship will be half of the financial assistance per year provided the student is making satisfactory progress. The assistantship will be an additional half of the financial assistance per year provided the student is making satisfactory progress and performing well in his or her assistantship duties. Students will be assigned to either a research assistantship or a teaching assistantship for each semester during the first 2 1/2 years in the program. They will rotate across the two types of assistantships, which will provide mentoring experiences for students on the teaching dimension and the research dimension. Each semester-long assistantship will entail 15 hours per week as a research or teaching assistant under the supervision of a faculty member. In the third year, students are expected to serve as a research or teaching assistant for one semester and to teach one course for the other semester. During the fourth and fifth year (and the sixth year if a student is still in the program), students will teach two courses per year for their assistantship. Note: Students must successfully complete one teaching assistantship and attend the CELT class for graduate teaching assistants before they teach a class independently.

In addition, the student must demonstrate the ability to conduct independently an intensive research project and document their results in the form of refereed publications, presentations, and a final thesis dissertation. Specifically, candidates for the Ph.D. degree must: Complete a minimum of 48 credit hours of approved course work; Pass a qualifying examination; Present an acceptable dissertation prospectus to a dissertation committee; Make an original contribution to the field of chemical engineering in the form of a dissertation suitable for publication; and Defend the dissertation during a public presentation. The Ph.D. degree requires 48 hours of approved graduate course work plus a thesis.

Ph.D. candidates who have completed an M.S. at another institution will be potentially allowed to transfer a small number of credit hours toward the Ph.D. Frequently, students without an undergraduate chemical engineering degree will enroll in the graduate program. To ensure that all students are familiar with the fundamental principles required of chemical engineers, students entering the graduate program with a bachelor's degree in an area other than chemical engineering will be required to take four undergraduate courses—Unit Operations I, II and III, and one of either Reactor Design, Process Control or Process Design. On the recommendation of the Graduate Committee, these requirements can be modified based on each student's specific background. These undergraduate courses do not count toward the total graduate-level credit requirement for the advanced degree. Graduate students may take these courses out of sequence and/or concurrently in order to expedite completion of this requirement. Completing the Ph.D. requirements normally requires four to five years of full-time study beyond the B.S. degree. Students already possessing an M.S. degree in chemical engineering typically require one year less time.

An Engineering Elective is any non-required CENG course, a course offered by one of the engineering departments (BMEN, ENGP), or a course offered by Computer Science (COSC and CMPS). Advanced Specialization Electives are typically selected from the following list: • Any 3000-level or above CENG, BMEN, CHEM, CMPS, COSC, ENGP, MATH, MPEN, or PHYS • CELL 3030: Molecular Biology • CELL 3750: Cell Biology (pre-req: CELL 3030) • EENS 4250: Isotopes in the Environment • EENS 4360: Environmental Geochemistry (pre-req: EENS 2110) • ENRG 4100: Energy Markets, Economics, and Policy • ENRG 4110: Energy Financial Modeling • ENRG 4200: Energy Fundamentals and Trading • SPHU 3160: Biostatistics in Public Health (pre-req: SPHU 1010 and 1020) • SPHU 4160: Intro to Statistical Packages (pre-req: SPHU 3160) • SPHU 4400: Practical Bioinformatics • SPHU 4410: Data & Information Management in Public Health (pre-req: SPHU 1010 and 1020) Any Substitutions must follow the Petition for Degree Plan Modification process. Technical electives, Engineering electives, and Advanced Specialization electives must each satisfy a minimum of 6 credit hours, and at least 3 credit hours of Technical and Engineering electives must be at the 3000-level or above. For all electives, the courses must be of at least the same technical rigor as the first freshman-level course we require from that department (i.e., General Chemistry for CHEM courses, General Physics for PHYS courses, Calculus I for MATH courses. CELL 1010 is the benchmark for CELL courses). Additionally, courses containing significant overlap with core curriculum are excluded (list found here). Students are encouraged to inquire with their CBE Advisor or the Undergraduate Committee Chair if they are unsure about a potential elective. Note that a maximum of 3-credit hours can be satisfied from Professional Development Courses. Courses for non-science majors will not fulfill the elective requirements. **Students may take courses from a biochemistry series offered by either Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering (CENG 4450 and 4460) or Chemistry (CHEM 3830 and 3840) to satisfy one or both courses of the Advanced Specialization Elective requirement. Once a biochemistry course has been taken and a grade of D- or better has been granted, the parallel course from the other department cannot be taken to satisfy any elective requirement for the Chemical Engineering degree. As an example, a student who withdraws from CHEM 3830 can take CENG 4450 to satisfy the first Advanced Specialization requirement. If the student then goes on to earn credit for both CENG 4460 and CHEM 3840, one of the courses can be used for elective credit but the other ‘biochemistry II’ course will not be counted as an elective, technical or otherwise.\n",

      "The minimum requirement for the PhD degree is six courses (18 course hours in total) at the 7000 level, four of which must be core courses. Out of the four core courses, up to three can be taken within one field of chemistry. The core courses, offered by division, are: Physical Chemistry: CHEM 7110 Intro to Quantum Mechanics (3 c.h.) , CHEM 7120 Statistical Mechanics (3 c.h.) , CHEM 7150 Chemical Physics (3 c.h.) ; Inorganic Chemistry: CHEM 7210 Inorganic Stru & Bond (3 c.h.) or CHEM 7220 Inorganic Reaction Mechanics (3 c.h.) , CHEM 7230 Organomet/Trans.

(both courses combined count as one). The remaining two elective courses should be selected from 7000 level chemistry courses (other than 7870 - 7900) or 7000 level courses from other SSE departments that meet the approval of the Graduate Affairs Committee. In addition, students should register for a total of six hours of seminar over the first six semesters of matriculation. In all, a total of 48 course hours are required for the Ph.D. students.  Up to 24 course hours of the 48 hours required may be taken in CHEM 7890 Techniques of Research (1-9 c.h.) - CHEM 7900 Techniques of Research (1-9 c.h.) and special interest courses (6000 or above) offered by the Department of Chemistry or related departments.  Students should obtain prior approval of the Graduate Affairs Committee to ensure that the courses taken in other departments will count toward the degree.

Students unable to complete 6 cumes in 6 semesters will be automatically placed in the  M.S. program and be expected to complete the M.S. thesis by the end of the seventh semester. Seminar Registration for, and attendance at, Department seminars is required.  Students are required to register for Division Seminar every semester until they have been admitted to candidacy.  Six (6.0) hours of credit for seminar courses may be applied to the Ph.D. degree requirements.  All Ph.D. candidates must present a seminar to the Department based upon a topic from the current chemical literature.  The seminar must be presented before the end of the students' 4th semester in residence. The seminar should be scheduled with the Chemistry Department coordinator for seminar programs.  Students presenting seminars are required to enlist two faculty to attend their seminar and provide the faculty with a Seminar Review Form for a written review of the quality of the presentation; the  Seminar Review Form can be obtained from the department website.   Students should remember that faculty will only agree to attend if given sufficient notice (one month minimum) before the seminar. Tenure Requirement The maximum time allowed by the SSE Graduate Program for completion of the Ph.D. degree is seven years. The Department, however, strongly encourages students to attempt to complete requirements in no more than five years. Dissertation Committee After choosing a research advisor (no later than the second semester of residence), students must obtain agreements from a minimum of three chemistry faculty members (other than the dissertation advisor) to participate as members of their dissertation committee.  Two members must be within the division of the research advisor and one member of the committee must be from a division in the Chemistry Department other than that of the research advisor.  Students must submit to the Chemistry Department a signed and completed Thesis / Dissertation Committee Form . The form can be obtained on the department’s website. Dissertation Prospectus By the end of the fifth semester, students must submit a written proposal of their dissertation research project and make an oral presentation of it to their dissertation committee.  The prospectus should be approximately two thousand words in length (excluding legends and references). The cover sheet should state the student’s name, department/program, the title of the proposed dissertation, and the name of the chair and the other members of the committee. The introduction of the prospectus should contain a summary of earlier work on the problem in question. The body should include an orderly description of the work accomplished to date and a plan for future investigations. The conclusion should clearly state the anticipated nature of the investigation results. Major sources of information should be indicated and a selective bibliography attached. The prospectus should be submitted to the SSE Dean's Office along with a signed copy of the prospectus approval form. Admission to Candidacy Prior to the dissertation, an application for admission to candidacy should be filed with the SSE.  This should be done approximately one semester before the final dissertation.  Deadlines are posted on the SSE website. Dissertation The Ph. D dissertation must reflect the ability of the student to conduct an independent investigation which results in an original contribution to knowledge or an original interpretation of existing knowledge. The research is expected to be reported to the scientific community in the form of publications in refereed journals and/or conference presentations. The student should consult the SSE Dean's office to determine the proper format for the Ph.D. dissertation. Upon completion of all other Ph.D. requirements, the student will  give a final oral defense of their Ph.D. dissertation. A written draft of the dissertation should be available to the dissertation committee two weeks prior to the oral defense.  This final examination will consist principally of the defense of the dissertation, but may be extended at the discretion of the Ph.D. examining committee to include course material. The satisfactory completion of this final requirement completes the student's doctoral program.\n",

Students graduating early enroll in the capstone in the junior year. A two-semester Honor’s Thesis in Computer Science can be used in place of the Capstone Project requirement. Academic requirements In order to enroll in the senior capstone course, the student should achieve a cumulative GPA of 2.8 or above for the five introductory core courses. In order to graduate with the coordinate major in computer science, the student should achieve a cumulative GPA of 2.8 or above in all CMPS courses. Declaring the coordinate major To declare the coordinate major in computer science, please complete and sign the major declaration form and email it to Ms. Debbie Ramil ( dramil1@tulane.edu ), who will assign you a coordinate major advisor, obtain the corresponding advisor's and the departmental chairman's signatures for your form, and return the form to you. The completed form needs to be submitted to the Advising Office. When you declare your pursuit of the coordinate major, you should have already declared your primary major. When the major declaration form is processed, you will be added to the CS students mailing list. In order to enhance your CS education, you may also wish to join computing-focused student organizations, such as Cookies and Code and Women in Technology (their info is on WaveSync).

Academic prerequisites The program is open to all students willing to put time and work into becoming computing professionals. It doesn’t assume that students have any previous computer science background. Many of our graduates have never programmed a computer before joining their first computer science class. The department holds several help sessions most days of the week to provide help to students when they have questions while working on computer science homework. Prior computing experience Advanced Placement (AP) computer science courses taken by a student in high school usually transfer toward overall college credit. (This is decided by the Tulane University Office of Undergraduate Admissions.) These courses do not have much overlap with our introductory courses and hence don’t count toward the coordinate major. If a student can demonstrate solid knowledge of the material covered in one of the required courses, after consultation with their faculty advisor, they can “skip” the required course and replace it with a CMPS elective of their choice instead. The minimum total number of completed CMPS courses should remain 10. Transfer coursework Transfer of college-level courses follows the standard Tulane credit transfer procedure. There is no special department-level limit on the number of courses that can transfer; we adhere to the limit established by Newcomb-Tulane College. In order for a course from another university to count for the coordinate major, it should match a corresponding Tulane course in content and/or complexity; mode of delivery (online, in-person, hybrid) doesn’t affect this evaluation. Computing courses on subjects not offered by Tulane might be transferrable. Students should confirm with the Department of Computer Science whether the course would transfer as a coordinate major course before registering. Study abroad With advanced planning, it may be possible to study abroad and complete the coordinate major. Students should confirm with the Department of Computer Science whether and how the foreign courses would transfer before registering. Programming languages We often get asked what programming languages we teach. In fact, we teach principles, concepts, and problem-solving approaches rather than specific languages. CMPS 1500 is in Python. CMPS 1600 uses Java, C, C++, Haskell, and a surprise language. The elective courses use a language that’s necessary to achieve the tasks of the course (e.g. Javascript, Scala, Ruby). Our successful students get used to learning new languages and are able to study the basics of any computer language on their own. Computer specifications Another common area of inquiry is about buying a computer. It is helpful and convenient to have a laptop. We don’t have a computer lab, and students work on their own laptops to complete most programming assignments. Model and make don’t matter; any modern laptop with Wi-Fi and a battery works. If buying or bringing a laptop is problematic, all necessary work can be done on university stationary computers or loaner laptops. It is possible to do well in all computer science courses without owning a computer.\n",

      "The M.S. program requires 30 credit hours of graduate coursework. Coursework requirements vary slightly depending on the chosen track, but consist of 12 credits of breadth coursework and 12-18 credits of depth coursework. Below we outline these degree tracks with their associated course requirements and provide some example curricula. We note that some of these example curricula do not have full-time enrollment in all semesters. Additional electives can be added in these slots as needed for full-time requirements. Coursework and Degree Tracks At the high level, the course requirements for the M.S. can be thought of as having a core requirement and an elective requirement . The core requirement is identical to that of our Ph.D. program, which requires of one core course from each of three breadth areas (Algorithms, Systems and Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning), for a total of three courses counting for 9 credit hours. Currently the Algorithms area requirement is fulfilled by CMPS 6610 Algorithms (3 c.h.) (Algorithms), the Systems area is fulfilled by CMPS 6750 Computer Networks (3 c.h.) or CMPS 6760 Distributed Systems (3 c.h.) (Distributed Systems), and the AI/ML area requirement is fulfilled by CMPS 6620 Artificial Intelligence (3 c.h.) (Artificial Intelligence) or CMPS 6720 Machine Learning (3 c.h.) (Machine Learning). The available degree tracks are the coursework , project and thesis tracks; each of these can also be completed in the 4+1 format for existing coordinate majors. Depending on the chosen option, the remaining 21 credit hours can be fulfilled by some combination of CS electives and thesis work. A CS graduate elective is any CS course that is 6000-level or higher, other than CMPS 7010 Research Seminar (3 c.h.) (Research Seminar). Core courses not counted toward the core requirement also can count toward elective requirements. A comprehensive list of current courses can be found here. Finally, thesis work can be conducted by taking CMPS 9980 Masters Research (0 to 3 c.h.) (Master’s Thesis) over two semesters for a grade. In both the coursework and thesis options we seek to encourage elective choices that are coherent enough to provide a specialized area of study, but flexible enough that students can explore different areas of computer science. Below we give examples of each track with sample curricula. Coursework and Project Tracks . The 21 credit hours remaining after taking core courses for the coursework only track consists of 7 courses. In some instances, it may be possible to submit a petition to the Graduate Studies Committee to count non-CS courses for elective credit (e.g., in an interdisciplinary subject area). No more than 2 such graduate courses may be counted toward M.S. coursework credit.

Project work can consist of research activities, or an independently chosen course of student supported by a faculty mentor (i.e., the Independent Study instructor). Project requirements do not rise to the level of a thesis but require that the project goals and progress be clearly evaluated in the syllabi of the courses taken.

The thesis option requires the completion of a Master’s Thesis supervised by an advisor chosen by the end of the 2nd semester. This option requires 6 credit hours of a thesis course (for a grade) and 15 credit hours of CS electives. Students must also form an M.S. Thesis Committee by the end of their 2nd semester. The M.S. Thesis Committee will consist of an advisor, one CS faculty member and one other SSE faculty member. The final thesis must be presented and approved by the committee prior to the end of their 4th semester.

SSE allows at most 6 credit hours to be counted toward both undergraduate and graduate degrees. In our department, advanced undergraduate electives are “mezzanine” courses that can count for undergraduate or graduate credit. For the 4+1 degree program, undergraduate students can count 6 credit hours of these courses toward both the CS coordinate major as well as an M.S. degree. Additionally, up to 6 additional credit hours of graduate coursework completed during the undergraduate degree (beyond the 120 credit hour requirement for undergraduate degrees) may also be counted toward the 4+1 degree. We give two sample curricula below. 4+1 Track: Data Science Focus Here, we assume that 2 undergraduate CS electives have been taken that will count toward the 4+1 degree.

      "Major: Computer Science, PhD - Requirements Content\n",
      "The program requires 48 credit hours of graduate course work, including core computer science courses, research courses starting in the first year, as well as an interdisciplinary research project. After an oral qualifying examination at the end of the fifth semester, the prospectus presentation is scheduled at the beginning of the seventh semester, and the final milestone is to complete and defend a dissertation. Course requirements are broken down into four areas: core courses, research courses, the interdisciplinary project and electives. Students are required to complete at least 48 credit hours (typically 16 classes) of coursework. This consists of: 9 credit hours of core classes 9 credit hours of research courses in the first two years 9 credit hours for the interdisciplinary project 9 credit hours of Computer Science electives 12 credit hours of general electives Each student is required to devise a schedule of courses in consultation with their faculty advisor. Core Courses As a breadth requirement that ensures a good foundation in graduate Computer Science coursework, each PhD student is required to take one class (3 credit hours) in each of the three categories below with a grade point average of at least 3.5 for these three courses. Courses in which an inadequate grade is received may be repeated once. These courses are from the following core areas: Algorithms: CMPS 6610 Algorithms (3 c.h.) Systems: One of CMPS 6750 Computer Networks (3 c.h.) or CMPS 6760 Distributed Systems (3 c.h.) or CMPS 6780 Computer Architecture (3 c.h.) AI/ML: One of CMPS 6620 Artificial Intelligence (3 c.h.) or CMPS 6720 Machine Learning (3 c.h.) The core courses have to be completed before the student's oral qualifying exam. Research Courses in the First Two Years Students are expected to engage in research early on, possibly as early as their incoming semester, but no later than the third semester. This is facilitated through research courses, as well as through the interdisciplinary project. Students are required to take at least three research classes (9 credit hours). Typically, these classes consist of CMPS 7010 Research Seminar (3 c.h.) in the first year, and one offering of CMPS 7020 Research in Computer Science (3 c.h.) in the second year. CMPS 7010 Research Seminar (3 c.h.) introduces students to research methods in Computer Science and to the research conducted in the department. In the CMPS 7020 Research in Computer Science (3 c.h.) course PhD students engage in a research project in Computer Science, under the direction of a faculty member, normally the student's faculty advisor. Interdisciplinary Project Each student is required to complete an interdisciplinary research project. The project is directed by a faculty member in Computer Science, and it consists of interdisciplinary research in a related area. During the rst-year research seminar classes, students are exposed to the research areas represented by the department faculty. Students are encouraged to identify a faculty advisor and a research topic for their interdisciplinary project during these seminar classes. If a student is unable to identify a project, the Graduate Studies Committee assigns a faculty mentor to advise the student and help develop an interdisciplinary project. The requirements for the interdisciplinary project are: Students must take one graduate class (3 credits or more) in Computer Science that prepares them for the project. Examples include CMPS 6630 Computational Bio & Bioinform (3 c.h.) , CMPS 6360 Data Visualization (3 c.h.) , CMPS 6640 Adv. Computational Geometry (3 c.h.) , CMPS 6150 Multi-agent Systems (3 c.h.) . Students must take one graduate class (3 credits or more) outside of Computer Science in the area most relevant to the interdisciplinary project. Students must enroll in a directed research course (3 credits), such as CMPS 7020 Research in Computer Science (3 c.h.) , to conduct the interdisciplinary research. The project culminates in a final report, possibly a published research paper, that summarizes the research outcomes. Students also are required to present the outcomes of their project in a public talk in the department. Typically, students are exposed to interdisciplinary research during their first year in research seminar classes. They start the interdisciplinary project in their third semester, and the expectation is that the project is completed by the end of the second year. Elective Courses The following elective courses are part of the PhD requirements: Computer Science electives: Students are required to enroll in 9 credit hours of graduate courses in Computer Science, chosen from PhD-level classes except for CMPS 7010 Research Seminar (3 c.h.) , CMPS 7020 Research in Computer Science (3 c.h.) , CMPS 7980 Independent Study (3 c.h.) . General electives: Students are required to enroll in 12 credit hours of general electives that can be CMPS 7020 Research in Computer Science (3 c.h.) or graduate courses in Computer Science, chosen from PhD-level classes except for CMPS 7010 Research Seminar (3 c.h.) . With approval of the Graduate Studies Committee, at most 9 credit hours of general electives may be replaced with graduate electives outside of Computer Science. Faculty Advisor and PhD Committee The student's faculty advisor and PhD committee oversee the research portion of the student's PhD program. Since students are expected to conduct directed research early in the program, they are encouraged to identify a faculty advisor and their dissertation research topic as soon as possible but no later than the end of their second year. The advisor often will be the faculty member advising the student on the interdisciplinary research project. Once a student selects a faculty advisor for their dissertation, that advisor serves as the main point of contact for the student. During the student's fourth semester, the student and the faculty advisor draft a proposed list of members of the student's PhD committee. The proposed committee must be approved by the Graduate Studies Committee. Initially, the PhD committee consists of at least three faculty members: the Computer Science faculty advisor and two additional faculty members. One committee member may be a Tulane faculty member from outside the Computer Science department, as appropriate. This committee administers the qualifying oral examination, attends the prospectus presentation and approves the written prospectus, and attends the thesis defense. During the summer before the student's third year, a fourth member of the committee is recruited. This member must be external to Tulane. The external committee member must attend the student's prospectus presentation, approve the written thesis and attend the thesis defense. The PhD Committee provides advice and guidance throughout the student's course of study, oversees the qualifying exam, the prospectus, and the dissertation defense. Oral Qualifying Exam and Prospectus Major milestones of the PhD program are the oral qualifying exam and the prospectus, including the prospectus presentation. The oral qualifying exam typically takes place in the the fifth semester, administered by the PhD committee. Before taking the oral qualifying exam the student must have completed the core requirements as well as the interdisciplinary project. The PhD committee compiles a reading list the student is responsible for in the oral qualifying exam. The purpose of this exam is to ensure the student is qualified to do independent research. The student is tested over a set of selected topics related to the student's research area. The student is informed about the material covered on the exam during the semester preceding the exam. The exam may start with a short presentation by the student and is followed by questions from the committee. The oral qualifying exam must be passed before the end of the fifth semester; it can be retaken at most once. At the beginning of the student's seventh semester, the PhD committee { the original three members and the external fourth member { attend an oral prospectus presentation given by the student. In the presentation, the student describes the central problem that will be addressed in the dissertation, including the background needed to place the problem properly in perspective. The purpose of the presentation is to give the student feedback about the proposed problem and to suggest additional issues that may be relevant to the proposed research. A final written prospectus of 3-5 pages in length that describes the proposed PhD research must be approved by the PhD committee and submitted to the School of Science and Engineering, no later than the end of the semester in which the prospectus presentation takes place. Dissertation Research and the Dissertation After passing the oral qualifying exam, a student focuses primarily on research in a particular area in which they have chosen to do their dissertation research, participating in research projects overseen by their advisor. In many cases, the student co-authors papers in conferences and journals about the research results obtained during these research activities. Then the dissertation will comprise a compilation of the results, with the expectation that the student utilizes the dissertation to present the material as a coherent theme. A draft of the thesis must be circulated to the PhD committee at least one month before the final version is due in the School of Science and Engineering, and the committee will render a verdict on whether the dissertation meets the standards to be accepted for the PhD degree.

      "Major: Doctor of Juridical Science - Requirements Content\n",
      "Tulane Law School also offers the Doctor of Juridical Science (SJD) to a small number of candidates who already hold the LLM as well as the first law degree (JD or LLB or equivalent). The SJD is a research-oriented degree requiring completion of a dissertation which makes an original and significant contribution to legal scholarship. Each SJD student is assigned a faculty advisor upon admission. During the first semester of enrollment, SJD students take between 10 and 12 credits of coursework. Thereafter, most SJD students work full-time on the dissertation until it is completed. Tulane’s expectation is that the final SJD dissertation will be submitted within four years following initial enrollment in the program. The dissertation is to make an original and significant contribution to legal scholarship. Each candidate defends his or her dissertation in an oral examination before a committee of the Tulane Law School faculty, supplemented with other University faculty where appropriate. Degree Requirements for the SJD Program: In order to obtain the SJD degree, a student must fulfill the following requirements, depending on the student’s particular circumstances upon admission to the program: Students admitted to the SJD program with a Tulane Law School Master’s degree awarded five or fewer years prior to admission to the SJD program are exempt from any further coursework requirement. Students admitted to the SJD program with a Tulane Master’s degree awarded more than five years prior to admission to the SJD program must complete an additional 10 hours of coursework with a grade of B or better in each course. Students admitted to the SJD program with a Master’s degree from a law school in the United States (other than Tulane) or from an approved foreign law school in all cases must complete an additional 12 hours of coursework at Tulane. All SJD students, including those exempt from some or all further coursework requirements, must be in residence for at least one year but are only required to pay full-time tuition and fees for at least one semester, typically the first semester of enrollment in the program.  Students wishing to enroll in courses outside that one semester may do so on the understanding that they must pay tuition for each additional course they take. Every SJD candidate must write and defend successfully a dissertation which makes an original and significant contribution to legal scholarship.  Unless specifically exempted from this requirement for very exceptional circumstances by the Graduate Programs Committee, the dissertation must be complete and the defense must take place within four years from the initial enrollment in the SJD program. Dissertation Committee: The committee will consist of three members one of whom is the supervisor who acts as the chair of the committee. The chair of the committee shall be a tenured member of the faculty. At least one of the other two members of the committee shall be a tenured or tenure-track member of Tulane Law School. Under normal circumstances, all members of the committee will be Tulane Law School faculty members, but there may be cases where it becomes necessary to ask a faculty member from another department of the University or a faculty member at another institution, foreign or domestic, to join the committee. The outside member must, however, be a tenured member of the faculty at his or her home institution. The selection of the dissertation committee will be decided by the student in consultation with the chair of the committee. The committee shall be empaneled at the earliest time after the candidate has taken residence but no later than the end of the first semester of residence. As soon as the committee has been established, the chair of the committee shall notify the Graduate Affairs Committee of the names of the members of the committee. The Graduate Affairs Committee shall transmit the information to the Assistant Dean for Academic Services for record keeping. Lengths of dissertations vary depending on the subject matter and the writing style of the authors, but as a general matter the length of a dissertation ranges between 200-300 pages, including appendix and bibliography. After the dissertation committee has approved the dissertation, the supervisor shall set up a meeting at which the candidate shall present an oral defense of the doctoral thesis. The dissertation committee will conduct the oral examination. The meeting for the oral defense is open to members of the Law School faculty. Clinical programs, the Trial Advocacy course and externships are not open to SJD students.\n",

      "Thesis Model Faculty Advisor The student will consult his/her advisor in order to develop a course of study and to gain the advisor's approval for course registration. The faculty advisor must be a regular (full time) member of the department. The potential applicant should contact the professor who is desired as advisor prior to making application to the Graduate Studies Program in the School of Science and Engineering. Admission to the EEB graduate program depends upon a faculty member committing to supervise the student's graduate program, including the thesis research and composition. Thus, each applicant must have contacted the potential advisor prior to the decision on her/his application for admission. Entrance Interview During the first semester of enrollment, each entering student interviews with the faculty advisor (Graduate Studies Committee Chair substitutes if an advisor has not been arranged) and two other regular faculty members. The purpose of the interview is to review prior courses taken by the student, discuss research interests and degree goals, and ensure that the student understands departmental graduate study procedures. Recommendations for coursework to address deficiencies or to enhance the student's program may be made during the interview. Download Entrance Interview Form .

In general, up to 6 semester hours of transfer credit will be accepted toward the Masters of Science degree. Guidelines for acceptability of transfer credit can be found in the Graduate Catalog of the School of Science and Engineering. The Chair of the Department must approve all transfer credits. Courses taken at Tulane are usually taken in the EEB Department, but as many as nine graduate credits from other departments or divisions may be counted toward the course requirement. Thesis A student's faculty advisor will also be the director of his/her thesis research. A thesis committee must approve the completed thesis. The thesis committee will consist of at least three faculty members including the student's thesis advisor. EEB faculty must comprise a majority of the thesis committee. Each student must request approval for the composition of the thesis committee by letter addressed to the Chair of the Department. The thesis research must be presented to the Department in a public forum and defended at an oral examination conducted by the thesis committee. Specific instructions for thesis preparation are given in the Graduate Catalog of the School of Science and Engineering. Non-Thesis Model (Terminal) In order to earn this degree, students must have been admitted to the EEB graduate program through the regular Tulane University admissions process. Students admitted to the program must have completed the requirements for a baccalaureate degree in any discipline that includes course work in Chemistry (General Chemistry, and either Organic Chemistry or Biochemistry) and Biology (Genetics, Ecology, and Evolution). Additional coursework may be required to make up deficiencies. Students will meet with the graduate advisor prior to the beginning of his/her first semester to discuss appropriate course work for this degree.

A maximum of 6 credits at the graduate level may be transferred to this degree program, at the discretion of the Chair of the Department. 4+1 Degree Program A Five-Year Combined Degree Program - B.S. in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology (EEBI) or Environmental Biology (ENVB) and M.S. in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology Description The five-year, combined degree program is open only to Tulane undergraduate students. It combines the Bachelor of Science degrees offered by the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology (EEB) with the terminal Master of Science degree in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, condensing what would normally be about six years of study into five years. Students pursuing the interdisciplinary bachelor's degree in Environmental Science may also apply. Undergraduate students typically graduate after four years of study, having fulfilled all regular requirements for the Bachelor of Science degree. The accelerated master's degree component allows six graduate credits (two 6000- or 7000- level courses) completed during the senior year to be applied to the B.S. degree as well as to the M.S. degree 1 . Each student pursuing the M.S. degree in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology then completes course work toward the master's degree during one additional year of graduate study. During the fifth (graduate) year the student typically completes a minimum of 24 credits of graduate work for a minimum total of 30 semester hours. The master's degree requires two semesters of independent study or internship courses instead of a written master's thesis. Each master's student will have a graduate advisor who has agreed to advise the student regarding the graduate program and to mentor the student during the independent study or internship. Rationale This degree program provides a broad background in the theories and methods of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at the graduate level, and comprises a minimum of 30 graduate credit hours. The purpose of the 4+1 master’s degree program is to provide students with training at the graduate level for one additional year beyond the baccalaureate degree. Thus, the master’s degree component provides more complete preparation for future career paths than the Bachelor of Science degree alone. Students electing to pursue this degree program typically desire a broad background rather than a degree program involving a specialization in a particular area based on a master’s thesis. Students who are interested in seeking employment with environmental agencies of federal, state, and municipal government; non-governmental organizations; and in private industry, including environmental consulting firms, will want to take advantage of the elective courses (listed below) that can be taken outside the Department in credit toward this degree. This degree program also will be useful to students planning to enter the field of environmental law as the elective courses outside the Department include law courses in that field. The degree program provides a foundation in Ecology and Organismal Biology. It requires independent study in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology (EBIO 6910, 6920) or Environmental Biology (EBIO 7150, 7160), or an internship with an approved off-campus agency (EBIO 7660, 7670). These components distinguish this terminal degree program from the thesis-based master's degree in EEB. The opportunity to undertake independent study or to accrue on-the-job training with a governmental or private agency through an internship lends a unique character to this program and may give graduates an employment advantage. Eligibility Applications and admissions for the 4+1 programs are rolling - applications are encouraged at any time of the year. Tulane undergraduate students are encouraged to talk with faculty about the 4+1 program during their junior year and may begin to take graduate level classes during their senior year, but should only apply formally during their senior year. By the end of the junior year (or at the time of application), candidates should have completed all LAS proficiency and distribution requirements for the B.S. degree and all core requirements for the major. Candidates are required to have a minimum 3.0 cumulative GPA and EEB GPA. To advance to the fifth (graduate) year, candidates must complete all requirements for the B.S. degree in EEB by the end of their senior year, while maintaining the minimum 3.0 cumulative and EEB GPAs. Teaching assistantships are not available to students pursuing this master's degree program. Footnote 1. During the senior year, two 6000- or 7000-level courses (6 credits), chosen in consultation with the graduate faculty advisor, may be completed toward both the bachelor's degree and the M.S. degree in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology. In some cases, students wishing to advance their work on the graduate component so as to devote more time to independent study or internship courses in the fifth year may petition the EEB Department to count as many as 12 credits of 6000- or 7000-level courses toward the graduate component. The six additional dual credits must be completed in excess of the 120 required for the bachelor's degree , giving the student a total of 126 credits or greater upon receiving the bachelor's degree.\n",

      "Major: Economics, PhD - Requirements Content\n",
      "Curriculum The degree of Ph.D. in economics requires 48 credit hours, passage of preliminary examinations within the first two years of study, a dissertation prospectus, a dissertation proposal, and a final dissertation defense. The course of study in the first year includes: microeconomics (two semesters) econometrics (two semesters) macroeconomics (one semester) applied econometric methods for policy analysis (one semester) In their second and third years, students will complete field courses in economics and in partner schools. Interdisciplinary fields of study have been designed so that students can draw from the expertise of faculty in Economics as well as our partner schools. The fields of concentration are: Health, education, and human capital Public economics and public policy Development, inequality, and poverty. While student research may ultimately focus on a single field of concentration, students will take classes spanning multiple concentrations and will be encouraged to explore synergies between multiple areas. Student Milestones, Required Examinations, and Monitoring of Progress to Degree There are six program milestones: (1) Preliminary Examination, (2) Field Paper, (3) Choosing a Dissertation Advisor and Committee, (4) the Dissertation Prospectus Defense (Admission to Candidacy), (5) the Dissertation Proposal Defense, and (6) the final Dissertation Defense itself. Satisfactory performance in the Ph.D. program is defined as maintaining at least a B average, obtaining no grade lower than a B-, and meeting these six milestones on time. The Preliminary Examination : is taken during the summer of the first program year. Failing the micro theory and/or econometrics portion(s) of the exam entitles a student to retake the failed portion in January of year II. Failing a second time is cause for dismissal. Students who fail a second time and are otherwise in good standing are typically allowed to continue in the program through the fourth semester. Satisfactory performance in 36 credit hours of approved graduate courses allows them to earn the degree of M.S. in Economics. Field Paper : In year II, students should choose a Field Paper Chair and, together with this Chair, form a Field Paper Committee. The Committee must have at least three faculty members on it, including the Chair. The Chair and at least one other Committee member must be tenured or tenure-track professors of Tulane University's Department of Economics. The third Committee member must be a tenured or tenure-track faculty member of Tulane University, from Economics or another discipline. Additional members from Tulane or other academic institutions may be added at the Chair's discretion. The student is to have a Field Paper proposal approved by the Committee by May 15 of program year II. The Field Paper is then written during the second summer. A full draft of the paper is to be handed in to the Chair by August 15, and a final version of the paper is due to the full Committee for approval by September 15. Dissertation Committee : The Field Paper Chair and Committee structure often evolve naturally into Dissertation Advisor and Dissertation Committee. However, this two-step structure also provides a natural opportunity to modify or entirely change the supervision of a student. It is expected that the Dissertation Committee will be formally constituted by December 15 of program year III. While there is no formal paperwork concerning this step, it is expected that the student will notify the Director of Graduate Studies via email, with copies to his Dissertation Committee members and to the Chair of the Department of Economics. 3 rd Year Prospectus Defense : With the Field Paper approved, the remainder of the Fall III semester is spent coming up with dissertation topics and choosing a Dissertation Committee. In order to aid the process of research topic development, third-year students are required to take ECON-7980, “Research Methods,” a class in which ideas are developed and presented on a weekly basis. Spring III is spent refining a dissertation prospectus under consultation with the Dissertation Committee, with the goal of a formal 3 rd Year Dissertation Prospectus Defense by May 15 of year III. Successful 3 rd Year Prospectus defense and satisfactory completion of the requisite coursework advances the student to Ph.D. Candidate status. It is the student’s responsibility to (i) schedule the defense with her/his Committee, (ii) obtain signatures for and submit to the Dean the “Approval of Dissertation Prospectus” and “Admission to Candidacy” forms, and (iii) give one copy to the Director of Graduate Studies and one copy to the Office Manager. A link to the required forms appears below. 4 th Year Dissertation Proposal Defense : Economics dissertations typically consist of three research papers. Years IV and V are entirely devoted to writing the dissertation. Students will be going on the job market in the fall of year V and job applications typically require submitting at least one fully polished dissertation paper to prospective employers by mid-October. With this objective in mind, the 4th Year Dissertation Proposal Defense should take place no later than May 15 of program year IV. The 4 th Year Proposal must consist of at least one fully developed paper and well-developed drafts of the rest of the dissertation. A successful 4 th Year Dissertation Proposal Defense implies certification by the Dissertation Committee that (a) a fully polished paper will be ready by the October job market deadline and (b) that it is feasible to complete the entire dissertation within the remaining Program year. Oral Defense: It is expected that the PhD in Economics will be earned in five years. Once the dissertation has been completed, the School of Liberal Arts requires an Oral Defense of the dissertation. In order for the degree of PhD in Economics to be completed the student must organize an oral defense of her/his dissertation, have the Dissertation Committee members sign the Oral Defense Approval Form, turn in a copy of the completed Form to the Economics Department Director of Graduate Studies, and submit the original signed form to the SLA Graduate Programs office immediately following the Defense.  Students are responsible for knowing the SLA deadlines for degree application and also knowing the requirements for format, paper type, number of copies to be submitted, and so on. These guidelines can be found under the heading “Directions for Completion of Graduation Requirements and Submission of Doctoral Dissertation” at this website: https://liberalarts.tulane.edu/academics/graduate-studies/graduating-students . A NOTE ON RESIDENCE REQUIREMENTS : Students should expect to complete the PhD program in five years and yet they will typically finish taking classes in the first half of that time.  The dissertation-writing phase thus accounts for at least half of the program. This is a very important, formative time when students mature as professional economists. They interact with the faculty, learn to teach and perform research by working with faculty members as RA’s or TA’s, present their own work in workshops and seminars, travel to conferences, participate in departmental seminars, and meet with visiting speakers. Students who choose to leave during this period typically never complete the PhD degree. It is therefore expected that all PhD students will remain in residence in New Orleans during this very important and formative period. Leaving New Orleans without obtaining explicit written approval from the student’s dissertation advisor and from the Director of Graduate Studies will constitute grounds for terminating financial support permanently. Any such written approval must be obtained by the end of the first month of the semester before the intended absence.\n",

      "Major: English Major - Requirements Content\n",
      "Required The course of study for the Major provides students with training in literary analysis and critical thinking, substantial instruction in writing, an understanding of literature and literary history in relation to systems of power, and the freedom to tailor coursework according to individual interests. Majors complete a minimum of 10 courses, which must include: THE GATEWAY COURSE ( ENLS 2000 Literary Investigations ): This course introduces majors to the discipline of literary studies, with an emphasis on close reading and analysis, theoretical approaches, research, and writing. 1 SURVEY COURSE ( ENLS 2010 Intro To British Literature I , ENLS 2020 Intro To British Literature II , ENLS 2030 Intro To American Literature , or ENLS 2040 Intro To Anglophone Literature): Our survey courses provide our majors with some understanding of literary and cultural history. By covering hundreds of years of literature, the courses make larger movements and shifts visible and provide a crucial context for understanding content in 4000- and 5000-level courses. 1 CAPSTONE SEMINAR ( ENLS 5010 Capstone Seminars ): Usually taken during the senior year, capstones are seminar-style courses (small class size; discussion-driven) that focus on a specialized field of study and culminate in a substantial research paper. Students who complete an English honors thesis do not need to take the Capstone, though they are welcome to do so for elective credit toward the Major. The Capstone also satisfies the SLA/Newcomb-Tulane Writing Intensive requirement. 7 ELECTIVES: In consultation with their major advisors, majors use electives to design their own course of study. Some majors opt for breadth, taking a variety of courses; others aim for depth, focusing on writing or a particular field of literature. There are some guidelines—see below for information about course level and distribution requirements. Students may also use electives to earn a Creative Writing Concentration . 3 of these electives must be 4000-level courses 1 elective may be at the 2000 level Students may take more than one Capstone Seminar, in which case the additional Capstone would count as an elective (and can substitute for one of the 3 required 4000-level courses) Students may complete an Internship (approved by the Department) for elective credit. (An internship does not substitute for one of the 3 required 4000-level courses.) DISTRIBUTION REQUIREMENTS: Majors must take at least one course in each of the following three areas that are central to literary study. Because these three areas have some fundamental inseparability, one course may satisfy up to two distribution requirements. These distribution requirements may be satisfied by a survey, an elective, or a capstone. Literature before 1800 American or Anglophone literature (i.e., not British) Non-dominant perspectives / non-canonical literature with an emphasis on race (including intersectional approaches to gender, sexuality, class, or disability) and on the analysis and critique of unequal systems of power (look here for information about approved courses) Course List Course ID Title Credits Gateway Course ENLS 2000 Literary Investigations 3 Survey Course Select one of the following: 3 ENLS 2010 Intro To British Literature I ENLS 2020 Intro To British Literature II ENLS 2030 Intro To American Literature ENLS 2040 Introduction to Anglophone Literature Electives Select three upper division electives (any ENLS courses at the 4000 level or higher) 9 Select three additional upper division electives (any ENLS courses at the 3000 level or higher) 9 Select one additional elective (any ENLS course at the 2000 level or higher) 3 Capstone Seminar ENLS 5010 Capstone Seminars 1 4 Total Credit Hours 31 1 Typically taken in the senior year Distribution requirements that can be satisfied by surveys, electives, or capstone: 1 course in literature before 1800 (British or American literature) 1 course in American or Anglophone literature (i.e., not British) 1 course in non-dominant perspective with an emphasis on race.\n",

      "The 4+1 M.A. Course of Study The program is designed so that students can complete the program in two years by taking two required graduate courses in their senior year: ENLS 7890 Fundamentals: Literary Theory in the fall term, and ENLS 7050 Bibliography & Research Method in the spring term. These two senior-year courses each count as an upper-level elective course in the student's undergraduate English major, and they count as well toward the student's credit hour total for undergraduate graduation. (Both courses concurrently count toward the student's M. A. degree.) In the second, \"+1\" year, students are expected to take four courses in each semester.

These 12 credits will then also be counted towards the 33 hours required for the 4+1 M.A. in French. BA Degree with Major in French 33 hours of course work 15 hours of core courses 18 hours of advanced courses, of which 12 will be taken during the senior year. (In exceptional cases, and depending on the rotation of course offerings, one or more courses taken in the junior year may be counted among these 12 hours.) Note: French majors doing the regular B.A. are not required to take 6000-level courses. 4+1 candidates will take 4 courses at the 6000 or 7000 level in their 4th year. 4+1 MA in French In their fifth year, students will take 4 courses in the Fall semester and 3 courses in the Spring semester. All course work should be taken within the Department of French and Italian. The M.A. Paper Students will write and defend an original research paper written under supervision of a faculty member and a second reader. It may be an expanded version of a course paper, and in its final form should be between 20 and 30 pages in length. At least one member of the M.A. committee must be a tenure-line faculty member. In the event that neither of the first two readers is a tenure-line faculty member, a third, tenure-line faculty member will be added to the committee. In all cases the first reader will be a faculty member whose institutional appointment includes the expectation of research. The revised paper is to be submitted to the first reader by March 1st. The defense must take place no later than the first week of April. The supervising professor and a second faculty reader will participate with the student in an oral defense of the paper. The defense will be open to the departmental faculty. Language Requirement Before the end of the Spring semester of their fifth year, all students in the 4+1 M.A. program will be expected to demonstrate reading competence in one of the following languages: Arabic, Creole (both taught within the department), Spanish, Italian, Latin, German, or medieval Occitan. The department will consider students’ petitions to have other languages accepted, but acceptance will depend upon the student making a case for the usefulness of this language to his or her research. Diplômes de Français Professionnel If a 4+1 MA in French will open the door to increased career prospects, a Diplôme de français professionnel will give you the accreditation necessary to make these prospects a reality. Recognized by companies and organizations worldwide and adapted to the modern business and cultural world, a Diplôme de français professionnel will enable you to demonstrate the level of competency required by your future employers. They will also allow you to connect with international and French-speaking professionals and will help you on your path to becoming a successful global citizen. Designed and offered by the Paris Ile-de-France Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the Diplômes de français professionnel are calibrated to coincide with the different levels of the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR) developed by the Council of Europe, with diplomas ranging from level elementary (A2) to proficient (C2). Candidates obtain a diploma upon completion of an exam, which is conceived based on real-life professional situations and is adapted to today’s economy. To prepare for the exam, students will be offered, depending on interest expressed, study skill workshops or individual sessions. They will also be given practice exams to take. In order for the department to gauge student interest in each particular diplôme , please declare your interest early during the semester by sending an email to Professor Sojic: asojic@tulane.edu . Filing for the Degree Students must inform the School of Liberal Arts of their desire to participate in graduate ceremonies. The Graduate Director will be asked to confirm, by audit, that candidates have completed their degree requirements. Students must also complete a departmental form available from the Graduate Director, called the 4+1 M.A. Checklist (see Graduate Handbook appendix).

      "Major: French Studies, PhD - Requirements Content\n",
      "The Ph.D. builds on a solid core of course work in French Studies and includes as well a concentration in an interdisciplinary subfield that may be fulfilled entirely or in part through courses taken in other departments or programs. The degree is interdisciplinary and integrative, drawing on diverse fields for a broad methodological base. Coursework Students must complete a minimum of 54 credit hours, including transfer work and work already presented for the M.A. degree. For students entering with a B.A., it is expected that course work will be completed by the beginning of the third year of study. Students will graduate with a Ph.D. in French Studies and a concentration in one of five integrated areas: Visual cultures and technologies – Courses in film, urbanism, new media, performance European studies – Courses in human rights; political, cultural and institutional histories; Islam in Europe; medical anthropology; and ethno-psychiatry Francophone colonial and post-colonial studies – Courses in Atlantic, Caribbean and African area studies; Creole(s) and creolization; Arabic and Islamic studies Language and identity – Courses in theory, philosophy, ethics and law, minority languages and identities, world languages and literatures Linguistics – Courses to include Survey of French Linguistics (FREN 6070), History of the French Language (FREN 6210), Field Research on French in Louisiana (FREN 6110), Special Problems in French Linguistics (FREN 6910), Translation Theory and Practice (FREN 6160), and courses in the Linguistics program (any course with an LING prefix). Students entering the program with the M.A. should declare their concentration at the end of their second semester on campus. B.A. students who will be continuing on to the Ph.D. should inform the Graduate Director of their choice of concentration when completing the M.A degree. Concentration in one of the four subfields will be constituted by successful completion of two graduate courses on topics related to the subfield. Students are also expected to demonstrate knowledge of their chosen field of concentration in the Ph.D. qualifying exams. One or both of the required courses may be taken in correlate departments or programs. Each semester, students at the Ph.D. level are allowed to take at most one course outside the Department of French and Italian. French 6050 (“Teaching French”) and French 6150 (“Critical Theory”) are required of all students and must be taken in the first semester that they are offered after the student enters the program. Beyond the 3 credits of 7000-level courses required for the M.A., doctoral candidates who begin the program with a B.A. must complete two additional 7000-level courses (that is, 6 credits of seminar-level courses). Students entering the program with an M.A. from another institution must complete two 7000-level courses in the Tulane program. During the course of their graduate study, Ph.D. students cannot take more than 3 hours (1 course) in independent study. Independent studies courses are approved only in exceptional cases; students are encouraged to fulfill their course requirements through regularly scheduled courses. Ph.D. Qualifying Exams For students entering the program with a B.A., two of three written Ph.D. preliminary exams will be taken in the Spring semester of the student’s third year, no later than two weeks before the end of classes. The specific date will be determined on an annual basis by the Graduate Advisor. The third, self-designed, exam will be taken in the second full week of classes of the Fall semester of the student’s fourth year. Students entering the program with an M.A. will take their first two exams in the Spring semester of their second year, no later than two weeks before the end of classes. The specific date will be determined on an annual basis by the Graduate Advisor. These students will take the third, self-designed, exam in the second full week of classes of the Fall semester of their third year. In the first week of the Fall semester prior to the semester in which the student plans to take the first two exams, they must notify the Director of Graduate Studies. The Director of Graduate Studies will then contact the student’s prospective dissertation advisor, who will serve as head of the examining committee and will select two additional readers. Students will sit for three written examinations and an oral examination. The oral examination will normally take place in the week following the first two written exams. All three written exams are take-home and open-book. The questions for the written exams normally will be made available to the student on a Friday morning at 9:00 a.m., and the answers must be submitted electronically to the examining committee by 5:00 p.m. of the following Monday. It is expected that the answers be both synthetic and analytical, and that they demonstrate familiarity with the primary and secondary texts on the reading list independently of recourse to lengthy quotation and paraphrase. All sources consulted must be duly cited. For each written exam, the student will answer either one or two questions. Students will normally write from 3500 to 4200 words (i.e., 10 to 12 pages in 12-point Times New Roman font with one-inch page margins) for each exam. If an exam consists of two separate questions, the 10 to 12 pages should be divided more or less evenly between them. The first written examination will cover a particular century. The second written examination will cover either a century or one of the four sub-fields listed above. The third, self-designed, written examination will be based on a reading list composed by the student in close consultation with their prospective dissertation director. The reading list for the self-designed exam should not significantly overlap with the reading list for either of the other two written exams and should be considered a blueprint for the dissertation bibliography. The oral examination will last for approximately one hour, the first twenty minutes of which will consist of the student’s analysis of a literary text. The analysis should not be read but presented extemporaneously from a copy of the primary text along with an outline or notes prepared ahead of time by the student. The remainder of the oral exam will cover the same material that was initially tested on the two written exams. The passage for textual analysis is chosen by the committee head in a conversation with the student in the semester prior to the examination semester. The student will not know ahead of time the precise work from which the text for analysis will be drawn, but will be provided with the text immediately upon his or her completion of the written exams. For all preliminary exams, the language of examination will be alternately French and English. The first exam will be written in one of those two languages and the second exam will be written in the other. The self-designed exam is to be written in the same language as the dissertation. The opening portion of the oral exam (the textual analysis and subsequent questions or comments pertaining to the analysis) will be presented in French. The remaining portion of the oral exam will be conducted primarily in French, but examiners may also ask questions in English, particularly when the reading material being tested is in English. When students announce their intention to sit for the Ph.D. exams, they should remember to inform the Director of Graduate Studies of their choice of language for each of the written exams. All examinations will be evaluated on a Pass/Fail basis, and a failed exam may be re-taken only once, normally within two to three weeks of the original exam. Students must pass all four exams, written and oral, in order to be admitted to candidacy. They will be informed of the result of the oral examination immediately following that exam, and they will learn of the committee’s decision regarding the first two written exams, including any need for re-takes, only after all sections of the exam (both oral and written) have been completed. Once the student has passed the self-designed exam, s/he will meet with the members of the examining committee to discuss the answer(s) to the exam and obtain guidance for writing the prospectus. Defense of the dissertation prospectus The dissertation prospectus should be defended by December 15 of the semester in which the student sits for the self-designed exam. The prospectus is approximately 10 to 15 pages in length, including a supporting bibliography that convincingly lays the ground for subsequent dissertation research. The student should be familiar with the works listed in the bibliography and be able to explain their relevance to the research project. After summarizing the prospectus, the student will answer questions from the faculty. The prospectus is to be approved by the dissertation director (first reader) and by two other professors serving as second and third readers. All committee members and all full-time faculty of the Department of French and Italian are invited to attend the prospectus defense, which is to be held during the academic year, but not during semester finals or between semesters. The prospectus must be submitted to readers no less than two weeks before the date of the defense, with a copy left in the conference room for other faculty to read. Upon successful defense of the prospectus, the student should ask readers to sign the form provided by the School of Liberal Arts ( http://tulane.edu/liberalarts/upload/prospectusform1.pdf ) . Reading knowledge examinations Students must demonstrate by examination reading competence in a second foreign language (beyond the language presented for the Master's) that is pertinent to their field of study. Students normally choose from among Arabic, Creole, Spanish, Italian, Latin, German, and medieval Occitan, but they may petition to have another language accepted if they can clearly demonstrate that it will be of significant use in their research. Language competence may be demonstrated by passing an examination administered by the department at Tulane in which the language is taught by standardized (ETS) examination, by official record of competence demonstrated elsewhere at the graduate level, or by satisfactory performance in a 6000- or 7000-level course taught in the language. In the summer, the Graduate School may offer reading-competence courses in languages for which there is adequate demand. Satisfactory performance on an exam given at the end of the course fulfills the reading-competence requirement for the degree. However, students may, if they wish, opt to take one of the external exams (as listed in the paragraph above) rather than sit for the in-course examination. As an alternative to demonstrating competence in this second foreign language (actually a fourth language, beyond French, English, and a third language for the M.A.), students may elect to do advanced coursework in the same language in which they demonstrated competence for the M.A. Successful completion of a graduate course requiring reading, speaking, writing, and lectures in that language will be accepted by the department in lieu of an examination in an additional language. Students who wish to conduct research in the early periods, as well as those who wish to pursue topics in other fields requiring special linguistic competence, are strongly urged to consult with faculty members in the relevant fields so that they may plan which languages to study. Defense of the dissertation The oral defense of the dissertation, held after the dissertation has been approved by all three committee members (or, if necessary, by two out of the three), will be open to all members of the committee and to all full- time faculty of the Department of French and Italian.\n",

Teaching Assistant Requirement All PhD students at SPHTM are required to serve as a teaching assistant (TA) for two SPHTM courses while enrolled in the PhD program. The courses for which the student will serve as a TA must be approved by the PhD program director. Comprehensive Exam On completion of doctoral coursework, students will be required to pass a comprehensive exam to demonstrate global health management and policy PhD program competencies. Comprehensive exams are administered in the spring of the fourth semester.  They consist of take-home exams that cover three core areas (theory, design, and methods) as well as a subject matter exam that is individualized to each particular student’s interest.  Each portion of the exam is graded by two graders.  If students fail any particular question from either grader they must retake the entire area. Doctoral Committee After successful completion of the comprehensive examination, the student forms a dissertation committee and develops a prospectus. The committee must include a minimum of three members with at least two faculty from the Department of Global Health Management and Policy and one external to the school. Prospectus Students work with their advisor and doctoral committee to determine a research hypothesis and prepare a prospectus of proposed dissertation research. The research prospectus is presented and defended at least one semester before the dissertation defense. Following the successful defense of the prospectus, students are admitted to PhD candidacy and proceed with dissertation research. Dissertation Students must conduct original scholarly research and defend a dissertation based on that research. The dissertation research demonstrates scholarly work and is the basis for the dissertation. Many graduates of HPAM follow the three-paper model as this delivers publishable units closer to what is demanded by the types of jobs graduates of this program pursue.  The student must defend the dissertation in an oral exam.  This process must be completed within seven years of matriculation into the PhD program. Model Schedule (not including PhD Foundational Courses) The model schedule represents an overall plan for completing degree requirements. Students should consult an advisor to plan their actual schedule in terms of total credits per semester and course sequencing.

The M.S. is NOT awarded simply for an accumulation of credits, but for a distinct and definable program of study. Requirements 1. Plan of study including: A 25-50 word description of the coherent discipline, which may cite similar programs of study at other universities. List of intended courses. Endorsement from two regular Tulane SSE faculty members who together represent the interdisciplinary expertise from different departments/programs;  for students already enrolled in a PhD program, the dissertation research advisor must approve the plan.  One department must agree to monitor the student's progress. 2. A minimum of 30 credit hours of graduate-level course work. At least 24 credit hours must be earned in the Tulane School of Science and Engineering (SSE). With prior approval, up to 6 relevant graduate credit hours from other Schools of Tulane University may be applied toward the M.S. degree. With prior approval, no more than 6 graduate credit hours may be transferred from another university; such credits cannot have been applied to another Masters-level degree. With prior approval, students may complete an empirical master's thesis in the defined discipline under the direction of an SSE faculty member.  Students who successfully complete a master's thesis may elect to complete only 24 credit hours of graduate-level course work (i.e., the master's thesis substitutes for 6 of the 30 credit hours for the M.S.).   In most cases, an interdisciplinary thesis committee will comprise faculty from at least 2 departments or programs.\n",

A student from Germany, however, might focus her studies somewhat differently, seeking exposure to common law subjects and to other areas which she would be unlikely to have studied previously. Each student designs his or her course of study with the assistance of a faculty advisor. In addition to fulfilling the General Degree Requirements, all candidates for the LLM in International & Comparative Law are required to enroll in a total of 13 semester hours of international and comparative law courses. All students who have not already taken a public international law course are required to take Public International Law, with the remaining 10 hours of specialized coursework chosen from the following offerings: Civil Law Seminar Comparative Law: European Legal Systems European Union Law European Law of Obligations: French or German European Legal History Foreign Affairs and National Security Human Rights Discourse Immigration Law International Sale of Goods Transnational Litigation International Business Transactions International Commercial Arbitration International Criminal Law International Environmental Law International Human Rights International Income Tax International Intellectual Property International Trade, Finance and Banking Law of the Sea Maritime and National Security Law Products Liability & Mass Torts in Comparative Perspective Any one-credit mini-courses in international and comparative law\n",

Fifteen credit hours must be in art history pertaining to areas outside Latin America. The balance of credit hours are electives; they may be in art history and/or Latin America, but they may also pertain to other areas relevant to the student’s work (e.g., European history, Medieval thought, writing systems). The Latin American Studies core seminar is required, as is a course on art historical method and/or theory. All courses must be at the 6000 and 7000 levels. Students must develop a primary concentration (e.g., Pre-Columbian, colonial, or modern) and a secondary one. The second concentration may be within Latin American art (e.g., Pre-Columbian, colonial, or modern), or it may cover a comparative area (e.g., modern Latin American art paired with modern European art, or colonial Latin American art paired with medieval and early modern European art). Twenty-one semester hours (7 courses) must pertain to the primary concentration, and 12 semester hours (4 courses) must pertain to the secondary concentration. These courses may be in Art History or other disciplines with Latin American content. For example, a student with a primary concentration in Precolumbian and a secondary concentration in colonial would take 7 art history and anthropology courses with a Precolumbian content, and 4 courses with a colonial content in art history, history, or literature.\n",

      "Distribution Requirements Degree requirements include 30 credit hours as follows: Course List Course ID Title Credits Select a primary concentration (History, Anthropology, etc.) 12 Select a second supporting concentration 6 Select a third supporting concentration 6 LAST 7000 Core Seminar 3 Select one of the following options: 3 Option One: The M.A. thesis, written under the direction of a thesis director and approved by a faculty committee. Option Two: A three-hour course in theory or methodology in the primary concentration. Total Credit Hours 30 Option One: The M.A. thesis, written under the direction of a thesis director and approved by a faculty committee. Students register for thesis credit in the fourth semester ( LAST 8990) and are required to participate in a thesis writing workshop under the direction of the Graduate Advisor. This is a graded course. A passing grade is assigned for the thesis by the Graduate Advisor if the student successfully defends the thesis by the end of the Spring semester. [NOTE: If a student plans to graduate in the Spring Semester of their second year of study, the thesis must be completed, defended, and submitted to the School of Liberal Arts in final form usually by the first week of May.] If the student has not completed and defended the thesis by the end of the Spring semester of the second year of studies, a grade of “I\" (Incomplete) will be reported until such time as the student completes the thesis AND applies to graduate. If the student fails to complete the thesis within one year of the end of the second year of study, the “I’‘ grade will convert to a failing grade. Option Two: A three-hour course in theory or methodology in the primary concentration. This need not be a Latin American content course. For example, in Sociology, the relevant courses are “Intermediate Social Statistics\" and “Intermediate Sociological Methods’‘; in Anthropology, “Field Methods in Social and Cultural Anthropology\"; and in Political Science, “The Conduct of Research’‘ and “Statistics for Political Scientists.’‘ Where a department does not have an appropriate offering, the Stone Center Graduate Advisor will help the student arrange an independent study project in the methodology of the primary concentration. This course must be taken by the end of the third semester. Concentrations The concentrations are usually departmental/disciplinary and are intended more as a guide to help organize a student's curriculum around a specific research project. Where a student's program suggests that there is an educational and qualitative logic, it is also possible to declare one synthetic concentration that combines courses from more than one department. Such a concentration might be, for example, “Cultural Studies\" or “Mexican Studies.’‘ Students are also encouraged, in consultation with the Graduate Advisor, to take courses that may fall outside of their concentration areas if such courses are critical to the development of specific research skills, tools, methods, or content necessary in the pursuit of their research agendas. Language Requirement The requirement for graduation with the M.A. in Latin American Studies is demonstrated competence in either Spanish or Portuguese. Students are expected to pass a language examination in Spanish or Portuguese during the first year of study. The required level of competence in Spanish and Portuguese corresponds to “intermediate-high’‘ on the American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Language ( ACTFL ) scale or the Avant STAMP 4S scale. This competency is considered a minimum requirement. Students are encouraged to develop additional languages as needed by their research fields. Currently, the Avant STAMP 4S examinations are administered by the Language Learning Center ( https://liberalarts.tulane.edu/language-learning-center/language-testing/proficiency ). Native Spanish and Portuguese speakers are exempt from this requirement, though they are still encouraged to take the examination. Transfer of Credit Upon entering the program a maximum of six graduate-level course credits (two courses) may be transferred from another department of Tulane or another University toward your Latin American Studies M.A. degree. However, students who do choose to transfer two courses will lose one semester of M.A. funding (limiting thesis writers to three semesters and non-thesis writers to two). To be considered for transfer credit toward an M.A. degree, graduate work done at another institution must carry a grade of 3.0 (on a 4.0 scale) or better and must have been completed no more than four years from the date of first registration for graduate work at Tulane. Acceptance of graduate credit for work done at other graduate institutions must be approved by the Stone Center for Latin American Studies and by the Dean of the School of Liberal Arts. Although the official decision concerning the acceptance of transfer credit towards the Latin American Studies M.A. degree will be made only after the student has completed one semester of successful study in the program, the Stone Center Graduate Advisor can evaluate the transferability of previous coursework before the student enters the program. If you are planning to transfer credit, remember to contact your Graduate Advisor after you have completed your first semester in the degree program so that he may recommend your credit for transfer. Independent Studies Independent Studies can be an important part of your program if used properly and sparingly. Typically an independent project is created to fill an academic need or interest that is not being met by regular disciplinary offerings or to expand upon research begun in other courses but not fully completed. Ordinarily, the Graduate Advisor will not authorize students to take more than two stand-alone Independent Study courses during the course of their M.A. degree. Students may register for the independent study directly through the Latin American Studies program; but students should first attempt to register for the independent study through the department of the sponsoring faculty member. Please consult the Graduate Advisor for further information on registering for independent study.\n",

      "Major: Latin American Studies, PhD - Requirements Content\n",
      "Doctor of Philosophy in Latin American Studies Curriculum The degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Latin American Studies is awarded for mastery of a body of literature and for the production of imaginative and original research. A student may enter the program (1) progressing from the M.A. program in Latin American Studies at Tulane, (2) transferring to the program with an M.A. conferred by another Tulane department, (3) or by applying directly to the Latin American Studies Ph.D. program after having completed an M.A. in any discipline or field, or an equivalent Professional Degree (JD, MD, MBA, etc.). In each instance, prospective students must submit a formal application for admission to the Ph.D. program. Each semester doctoral students normally enroll in three classes and teach one class. By university regulations, students are allowed to enroll in a minimum of two courses while they serve as Teaching Assistants. Students also begin preparation for general preliminary examinations, which are given during students’ last semester of classes and should be taken no later than the first semester after the completion of all coursework requirements. These are normally in October or March. Upon satisfying the coursework and language requirements and completing the general exams, students begin research for the dissertation, presenting a formal prospectus for faculty approval. Once approved they can apply for admittance to candidacy for the doctoral degree and commence formal work on the dissertation, which must demonstrate their ability to carry out an original investigation in the field of Latin American Studies. Degrees are conferred only after the dissertation is approved in a formal defense before a faculty committee. Coursework and Distribution Requirements The minimum coursework requirement for the Ph.D. is 54 credit hours. Portions of this requirement are often satisfied by credit awarded for academic work completed in fulfilling requirements for the M.A. degree with thesis. Students with an M.A. in Latin American Studies from Tulane may transfer up to 30 credits of relevant work from their M.A. program, while students transferring from other departments at Tulane or other universities may transfer no more than 12 hours of relevant work (see Transfer Credit below). General requirements for the Ph.D. degree are: Thirty semester hours in the primary concentration, including a minimum of six semester hours in theory, methodology, and pedagogy. Students transferring to the Stone Center from other programs must take the Latin American Studies Core Seminar in their first Fall semester to satisfy three hours of the theory and methodology requirement. And all Ph.D. students must take the required Pedagogy and Professional Development course in the Spring semester before the academic year in which they are scheduled to teach the LAST 1010 course cycle for the first time. NOTE : Of the thirty semester hours in the primary concentration, twelve hours or four courses should be at the 7000 level when possible; and no more than nine hours or three courses should be stand-alone independent study. Twelve semester hours in a first supporting concentration; six of these hours, when possible, should be at the 7000 level. Twelve semester hours in a second supporting concentration; six of these hours, when possible, should be at the 7000 level. A demonstrated knowledge of at least two languages, including Spanish or Portuguese. The successful completion of three general preliminary examinations in the primary and supporting concentrations. The successful defense of a dissertation prospectus. The successful completion and defense of the dissertation. Concentrations The concentrations are usually departmental/disciplinary and are intended more as a guide to help organize a student’s curriculum around a specific research project. Where a student’s program suggests that there is an educational and qualitative logic, it is also possible to declare one synthetic concentration that combines courses from more than one department. Such a concentration might be, for example, Cultural Studies or Mexican Studies or Gender & Sexuality Studies, etc. Students are also encouraged, in consultation with the Graduate Advisor, to take courses that may fall outside of their concentration areas if such courses are critical to the development of specific research skills, tools, methods, or content necessary in the pursuit of their research agendas. Transfer Credits At the time of admission, the Graduate Advisor can provide an informal assessment about what previous course credit can be transferred to meet Ph.D. requirements, but University policy allows the Graduate Advisor to make a formal evaluation of requests for transfer credit only after students have completed nine hours in residence at Tulane. After that point, and before the student accumulates a total of 42 credit hours, the Graduate Advisor recommends the transfer of appropriate and germane credit to the Graduate Dean for approval. Students seeking transfer credits should be prepared to provide copies of syllabi and/or course term papers as evidence of the relevance of the courses in question to their graduate work in their Latin American Studies program. Only courses that have a theoretical or content-specific logic to a student’s Latin American Studies academic program will be approved for transfer credit. As noted above, students with an M.A. (with thesis) in Latin American Studies from Tulane may transfer up to 30 credits of relevant work from their M.A. program, while students transferring from other departments at Tulane or other universities may transfer up to 12 hours of relevant coursework. Acceptance of graduate credit for work done in other M.A. programs at Tulane or other universities is recommended by the Graduate Advisor and approved by the Dean of the School of Liberal Arts. To be considered for transfer credit, coursework must have received a grade of 3.0 or better on a 4.0 scale and must have been completed no more than six years before the date of first registration in the Center’s doctoral program. Only in very special cases, and with the recommendation of the Stone Center’s Graduate Advisor, will the Dean consider transfer of credit for courses taken earlier. Language Requirements The language requirement for graduation with the Ph.D. in Latin American Studies is demonstrated competence in two languages. Normally, one is Spanish; the second Portuguese. However, other languages may be presented if essential for the student’s research. German, Quechua, Nahuatl, or Kaqchikel are examples. Students are expected to pass a language examination in Spanish or Portuguese during the first year of study. The required level of competence in Spanish and Portuguese corresponds to “intermediate-high’‘ on the American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Language ( ACTFL ) scale or the Avant STAMP 4S scale. This competency is considered a minimum requirement. Students are encouraged to develop additional languages as needed by their research fields. Levels of competency similar to those described for Spanish and Portuguese are required in any language presented to satisfy this requirement. Currently, language competency is determined by performance on the Avant STAMP 4S examinations, which are administered by the Language Learning Center ( https://liberalarts.tulane.edu/language-learning-center/language-testing/proficiency ). All students, even native speakers, must be either examined for minimal linguistic competency as explained above or certified as to their native fluency by the Spanish and Portuguese Department. Certification of competency in a second language must be presented by the end of the second year of study. Transfer students are expected to pass one language during the first year of study, and a second language examination by the end of second year of study. Testing in languages that are not available through the Avant STAMP 4S process in the Language Learning Center should be discussed with the Graduate Advisor to determine if such testing is possible and what would be the procedures for such testing.\n",

      "Major: Linguistics, PhD - Requirements Content\n",
      "As a graduate student in linguistics, you are required to complete 48 hours of course work before advancement to candidacy, which will include at least one course drawn from each of the following categories: Acoustic phonetics Phonology Morphology or syntax Language variation and change (for instance, sociolinguistics, historical linguistics, dialectology, bilingual education, or multilingualism) Semantics, pragmatics, philosophy of language, or discourse A non-Indo-European language other than your native language (Note that this requirement can be satisfied by one of the Less Commonly Taught Languages offered at the 1000 level, which will be covered by the tuition waiver as long as you are a full-time student, but a course below the 6000 level cannot count towards graduate credit. Non-Indo-European languages taught in the Anthropology Department are 6000 level and above and so would count toward the graduate program as well as fulfilling this requirement.) Depending on your previous course work and training, you may be able to waive some of these courses. Course waivers are to be requested on an individual basis, and must be approved by the program graduate adviser. This range of courses ensures that you will receive a rigorous and broad background in linguistics, which will prepare you for your own research projects and will make you highly qualified for the job market. You should normally enroll in 12 credit hours (4 courses) per semester until you have completed the required course work for the Ph.D., which will normally take 4-5 semesters, depending on your background. This ensures that you will fulfill Tulane's residency requirement of four semesters of full-time study at the university, as well as Tulane's minimum course-hour requirements. (See the university graduate requirements for more information on Tulane's residency and course-hour requirements.) In all of your course work, a grade level of B- (B minus) is the formal minimum for a passing performance in the graduate program. Although a grade of B- is a passing grade, it is considered a \"weak\" pass. One or two B- grades can be cause for probation or dismissal. In addition to your course grades, however, the general assessment of your overall progress in the program will also include the opinions of the faculty. The faculty meets at the end of each semester to discuss graduate students' progress. Renewal of your fellowship from year to year is dependent upon continuing satisfactory progress in your studies. Language of Scholarship Requirement In addition to taking at least one course in a non-Indo-European language, you must show competence in a major language of published scholarship other than English. You should meet with your adviser or the program director to discuss your proposed language and your plan for fulfilling the requirement. This requirement must be filled before advancement to candidacy. If your native language is a major language of published scholarship other than English, you can use English to satisfy this requirement. For everyone else, competence can be demonstrated by (i) two semesters of language instruction at the junior (3000) level or above, or (ii) a translation exam. Comprehensive Examinations Students must take two Ph.D. comprehensive examinations, a general examination covering all major fields of linguistics and a special field examination tailored to their chosen field of dissertation research. The general comprehensive examination is to be taken in early September of the student’s third year (fifth semester) in the program, and the special field examination is to be taken in early to mid-January of the third year (sixth semester). You may petition the program to substitute a published paper for the special field exam. Dissertation Prospectus Immediately after taking your special field examination, if not before, you should form your dissertation committee. It must consist of at least three tenured or tenure-track Tulane faculty members. Your committee may have additional members as well, but this is not required. Your first task with the dissertation committee is to write a research paper, called the dissertation prospectus. The prospectus should consist of a substantial dissertation proposal and a comprehensive bibliography. It may be based on a grant proposal to an external funding agency, particularly in the case of proposed fieldwork. The work described in the prospectus should lead naturally into your dissertation. The prospectus should contain a statement of the topic area of your proposed dissertation project, a problem statement, a statement of the theoretical orientation and methodology, and a comprehensive bibliography. Work out the specific details of your prospectus with the members of your dissertation committee. Once it is complete, you will schedule an oral defense of the prospectus before the members of your committee. The prospectus defense should take place before the end of your third year (sixth semester) in the program. Advancement to Candidacy After you have passed your comprehensive examinations and your language requirement and your dissertation committee has approved your prospectus, you will apply for Candidacy for the Ph.D. Once you have advanced, you are considered 'ABD' (All But Dissertation). Application for some research grants requires this status. Fieldwork You may find it necessary to conduct fieldwork before writing your dissertation. You are encouraged to seek outside funding to support your fieldwork. If you succeed in securing outside funding to replace your Tulane stipend for one year, you may be eligible to bank that year of stipend for use in your sixth year. If your research does not require you to absent yourself in order to pursue fieldwork, you may continue directly to writing your dissertation. Teaching You will normally be expected to teach undergraduate-level linguistics classes during one year of your time on stipend. In some cases you may be asked to perform other duties, such as serving as a research assistant, in lieu of teaching. Writing, filing, and defending the dissertation Following advancement to candidacy, you will normally be eligible for a fifth year of financial support to work full time toward the completion of the dissertation. Receiving your final year of fellowship is contingent upon your having met the following requirements: Achievement of ABD status Submission of an acceptable plan for research and writing during the final year of support Completion of the language requirements Students generally find writing a dissertation to be a challenging and rewarding process. However, it is also an inherently stressful activity. For this reason, you should meet regularly with the members of your committee at every stage of your project, and keep in touch with them about data collection and writing. And finally, remember that all of the faculty members have also written a dissertation (and likely supervised a number of them too), and are happy to discuss any issues that come up for you. Upon completion of an acceptable draft of your dissertation, you will then, in consultation with the chair of your dissertation committee, schedule a public defense of your work. All members of the Tulane community are invited to the defense, and anyone else is welcome to attend. You should prepare a short presentation of your work, summarizing the main research question(s), how you went about doing your project, and your key findings. Your dissertation committee will then ask you questions about your dissertation, as may other members of the audience, time permitting. There are a host of important deadlines to keep track of, as well as very specific formatting minutia which you must strictly follow in order to file the dissertation. Consult the relevant sections of Deadlines for Graduating Students . As always, you are ultimately responsible for being aware of and complying with all formal requirements and university deadlines. After you have submitted a complete draft of your dissertation, defended it publicly, and made any revisions suggested by your committee, you are ready to file the dissertation. Tulane's general guidelines permit a maximum of seven years from your initial matriculation to file the Ph.D. When the final version of the dissertation is accepted by the doctoral committee and filed with the university, and all other requirements are certified as fulfilled, you have earned a Ph.D. in Linguistics!\n",

One of the electives must be a computational course (PHYS 6170 Computational Physics and Engineering, MPEN 6290 Computational Materials Science and Engineering, or a computational course in another department approved by the graduate program advisor). Up to 6 credits may be fulfilled by Advanced Research I and II, with approval of the research supervisor and graduate program advisor. Advanced Research I and II may be taken at the same time as Research I-IV, with up to 6 credits of research allowed in one semester. Grades: Per the SSE Handbook: “A course in which a grade of C+ or less is earned cannot be counted toward a graduate degree. If a student receives one B- grade, the student is immediately considered for probation by the Associate Dean for Graduate Studies in consultation with the appropriate department/program. If a student receives two grades of B-, or one grade less than B-, during his/her tenure in the School of Science and Engineering, the student is placed on probation and considered for dismissal by the Associate Dean in consultation with the appropriate department/program.” A student who does not maintain the minimum 3.0 GPA in graduate course work will be subject to disenrollment. To continue in the program, MPE students must have a minimum 3.2 GPA from a minimum 8 graduate courses by the end of the 4th semester, not including research courses. Oral Qualifying Exam: The Ph.D. oral qualifying exam is presented by the student to a committee of three materials faculty at Tulane, chosen in consultation with the research supervisor and the graduate program advisor. A student must choose three research articles in agreement with committee members, one approved by each committee member, with each representative of a different topic in MPE not including the student’s specific research area. The student must present a maximum 10 minute overview of the paper followed by about 20 minutes of questions on that topic. The exam duration is 1.5 to 2 hours total. The student must attempt the oral qualifying exam by the end of the 4th semester. A second attempt is allowed and must be completed by the end of the fifth week of the fifth semester (two total attempts allowed). The committee votes pass/fail on each paper topic, with unanimous agreement required to pass that topic. A student must pass all three topics. If one or more is failed, the student is allowed one additional chance to pass the failed topics, but with a different research article for each (again agreed between the student and committee). Passed topics do not need to be repeated in the 2nd attempt. Any student who has not passed the qualifying exam by the end of the fifth semester of graduate study will be disenrolled from the program. Students who have met course and GPA requirements and have passed the qualifying exam become degree candidates. Those who have not are required to attend the weekly departmental colloquium. Faculty Dissertation Committee: Prior to the prospectus defense, the student and research supervisor form the faculty dissertation committee, which consists of the research supervisor (chair) and at least two other faculty members. One member may be from another Tulane department or other appropriate institution. The faculty dissertation committee (henceforth the committee) examines the student at the prospectus defense and oral dissertation defense, and approves the final written dissertation. Prospectus Defense: The prospectus defense demonstrates to the committee that the student has acquired sufficient knowledge in the specific research area and can effectively express that knowledge orally and in writing. A student must pass the oral qualifying exam before undertaking the prospectus defense. The prospectus defense consists of a written proposal and an oral defense: The written research proposal (10-15 pages) contains an introduction, proposed research and justification, methods, preliminary results, and discussion. It must be reviewed and approved by the committee before the end of the sixth semester of graduate study. The oral defense is a two-hour oral examination, including a research presentation (about 45 minutes) prepared by the student, given by the committee. The examination includes specific questions about the student's research as well as broadly focused questions on the general area of research. The oral defense must be attempted following approval of the written proposal, no later than the sixth semester of graduate study. If failed, the student is normally given a second attempt in the following semester. After two failures the student will be disenrolled from the program. Students who are sufficiently prepared are strongly encouraged to take the prospectus defense before the end of the 4th semester of graduate study. It is expected that, after completion of the oral prospectus defense, the Ph.D. candidate will obtain a Research Assistantship (RA) in the same research group. In order to encourage this, the faculty have adopted a policy for allocating graduate students on TA's to research groups. Annual Report: In April of each year, every Ph.D. student will submit a brief annual progress report (1-2 pages) to the research supervisor (and committee, when formed) summarizing research progress and accomplishments over the previous year, and future plans and milestones. This requirement is waived in the years when the prospectus and thesis defenses are completed. Dissertation: The final requirement for the Ph.D. degree is a written dissertation based on original research, approved by the committee, and its defense in an oral exam by the committee. Master's Degree: The master's degree is not a requirement for the Ph.D. in Materials Physics and Engineering. Admission with financial aid is only for doctoral students. However a graduate student may receive an M.S. in Physics based on 30 hours of approved graduate credit, or (if the research supervisor agrees to offer this option) an M.S. in Physics based on 24 hours of approved graduate credit plus a thesis deemed acceptable by the research supervisor. Research course credit does not count toward the M.S. in Physics degree. Program Transfers: Students in the Materials Physics and Engineering Ph.D. program cannot transfer to the Physics Ph.D. program without going through the regular admissions process. Exceptions to the requirements, due to extenuating circumstances, may be granted by vote of the PEP faculty. The Materials Physics and Engineering program requirements were last modified in Fall 2018. The requirements for students matriculating prior to Fall 2018 may be found here .

Suggested Curriculum Students should enroll in an appropriate calculus course in their first year of study. Students with no prior calculus course should normally take MATH 1210 Calculus I (4 c.h.) and MATH 1220 Calculus II (4 c.h.) , while students with one semester of calculus credit (or equivalent knowledge) should take MATH 1310 Consolidated Calculus (4 c.h.) . Students with two semesters of calculus credit should start in MATH 2210 Calculus III (4 c.h.) and contact a mathematics major advisor during the first semester for major program planning advice.  Students are encouraged to complete the core courses as early as possible in their programs. It is generally recommended to take MATH 3090 Linear Algebra (4 c.h.) before MATH 3050 Real Analysis I (3 c.h.) , but they can be taken concurrently. The MATH 3070 - MATH 3080 sequence provides the foundation for upper-level courses in probability and statistics. The Senior Seminar MATH 3980 - MATH 3990 is strongly recommended for majors who are not completing an honors thesis. Students considering a math major should arrange an appointment with the department Director of Undergraduate Studies early in their program. They will be assigned a major advisor who will advise them on course selection within the major. The major program is designed to provide the student with a solid foundation during the first two years and provide for a variety of programs of study during the junior and senior years. A major program in mathematics can provide a background for both graduate study and work in a variety of areas of the mathematical sciences as well as provide preparation for professional schools such as law, medicine, and business. The major program should be designed as early as possible with the student's goals in mind and with the help of the major advisor.\n",

      "Below is a brief outline of the requirements and further explanation of each step. Complete at least 48 hours of coursework-up to two courses may be taken in another department with the approval of the Graduate Studies Committee. For advanced incoming students, limited transfer credit is possible. Pass the Placement Exam in linear algebra and advanced calculus. It will be taken at the beginning of the fall semester (the student’s first semester). If a student fails to achieve A- in the linear algebra portion, he or she will be required to enroll in MATH 3090 Linear Algebra (4 c.h.) / MATH 6090 Linear Algebra (3 c.h.) . If the student fails to achieve A- in the advanced calculus portion, he or she will be required to enroll in MATH 4060 Real Analysis II (3 c.h.) / MATH 6060 Real Analysis II (3 c.h.) . Read the Placement Exam syllabus for details and previous exams. Pass qualifying written exams Analysis and two others chosen from among: Algebra , Analysis , Applied Mathematics , Differential Geometry , Probability and Statistics , PDE , Scientific Computation , and Topology . Read the exam syllabi for qualifying exams Pass an oral exam on specific topics of research interest to the student. Write a dissertation. Credit Hours The Ph.D. program requires students to complete at least 48 credits. This is equivalent to 16 courses (math courses are 3 credits each). All 7000-level courses may count toward the Ph.D. degree. Students in need of remediation, for example whose undergraduate major was not mathematics, may be advised by the Graduate Coordinator to take some undergraduate courses as 6000-level, but these cannot count toward the Ph.D. degree. Exceptions are 6210 (Differential Geometry) and 6300 (Complex Analysis). These two can be taken for Ph.D. credit if the Graduate Coordinator approves. It is not enough for a student to complete 48 credits to satisfy this requirement. The credits must be approved by the Graduate Coordinator and must be taken in such a way that they represent breadth and depth. Owing to these concerns, It is important that the student work closely with the Graduate Coordinator in order to formulate a sequence of courses that will satisfy the coursework requirement. This is done on an individual basis. A student who does not consult with the Graduate Coordinator may find that not all classes taken count toward the degree. Up to two courses may be taken in other departments when approved by the Graduate Studies Committee. At most two reading courses in total can be counted toward the required 48 credit hours. In addition, the transfer of up to 9 credits from another graduate program is possible with the approval of the Graduate Studies Committee. Read more about transfer credit » Placement Exam This is a 4-hour exam on topics from undergraduate courses on Linear Algebra & Vector Calculus. This exam is generally offered during the first week of each semester. A sign-up sheet is available in the math office near the end of the preceding semester. Every first-year PhD student has to take the placement exam prior to his/her first semester at Tulane. The topics covered in the Preliminary Exam are: Linear Algebra vector spaces inner products linear transformations linear equations matrix operations determinants characteristic equation eigenvalues and eigenvectors symmetric, skew-symmetric matrices hermitian, skew-hermitian matrices Jordan canonical form spectral theorem Vector Calculus limits in Rn partial derivatives differentiable functions of several variables optimization of functions in Rn (with and without constraints) the implicit function theorem the inverse function theorem Taylor's theorem integration in several variables line integrals the theorems of Green, Gauss and Stokes References you may want to study: Linear Algebra, Mathematica Labs by Terry Lawson Linear Algebra and Its Applications , 3rd ed., by Gilbert Strang Almost any textbook with Linear Algebra in its title Calculus by Boyce and DiPrima Almost any textbook with Advanced Calculus in its title Qualifying Exams These are comprehensive written exams. The student must pass three exams one in Analysis and two others chosen from among: Algebra Analysis Applied Mathematics Differential Geometry Probability and Statistics PDE Scientific Computation Topology The topics of each exam are based on the corresponding first-year graduate course sequence. For example, the Analysis exam covers roughly the material in MATH 7210 Analysis I (3 c.h.) - MATH 7220 Analysis II (3 c.h.) . Read the Qualifying exam syllabi Qualifying exams are offered the first week of each semester. A sign-up sheet is available in the math office near the end of the spring semester for the following semester’s exams. Students do not have to take all three exams at the same time; however, they should complete all three exams by the beginning of the third year in the Ph.D. program. Oral Exam After a Ph.D. student has passed the Preliminary exam and three Qualifying exams, the student should: decide on the area of mathematics in which he/she would like to write a dissertation (and) choose an advisor in this area The advisor and the student will decide on a reading list and topics for the oral exam. The exam usually lasts one to two hours and consists of a committee of 5 faculty who ask questions from the list of topics. The student and the advisor must choose the committee and set the date of the exam. This information must be communicated to the Graduate Coordinator prior to the exam for approval by the Graduate Studies Committee. It is not necessary that the student complete all coursework before taking the oral exam. Prospectus SSE requires a written prospectus. The Mathematics Department requires in addition that the student gives an oral presentation of the prospectus to the committee. Students are encouraged to write a 4-8-page double-spaced prospectus and prepare a 40-minute presentation for the dissertation committee followed by discussion and questions.  A suggested format is: 1. Cover sheet: should state the student’s name, department/program, the title of the proposed dissertation, and the name of the chair and the other members of the committee. 2. Introduction: a summary of earlier work on the problem, including a substantial number of references. 3. Statement of the dissertation problem: containing the goal of the thesis, possible sub-problems, and their importance in the global view of the field. 4. Investigation plan: containing an orderly description of the major steps of the investigation that will accomplish the goal of the thesis.  This is the plan you propose to follow in order to accomplish the goal and the committee should be convinced that the plan is likely to be successful. 5. Expected results: This section should include expected (partial) results of each major step of the investigation plan. 6. References: Major sources of information should be indicated, and a selective bibliography included. The prospectus should be submitted to the Dean’s Graduate Programs office along with a signed copy of the prospectus approval form. Dissertation The dissertation must contain original work by the student and demonstrate the student’s ability to carry on independent research that results in a genuine contribution to the field. The student must work closely with his/her advisor in order to have a clear vision of what is required of the dissertation. The student's dissertation committee must sign the dissertation to accept it before it can be submitted to the SSE . The student must also give a presentation of the research in the dissertation as an oral defense.

      "Major: MD/MPH - Requirements Content\n",
      "To receive the MD/MPH combined degree, students must fulfill all requirements for graduation from both schools before the graduation deadline. While students develop MD/MPH competencies specific to both their medical and public health curricula (see below for links to specific competencies), the competency that bridges the public health curriculum with the medical school curriculum is that MD/MPH students graduate from the MD/MPH program with the ability to use educational experiences in the School of Medicine to apply population-based and public health findings and principles in assessing individuals and groups at risk of disease and injury and to translate these findings and principles into recommendations and actions for improved health in clinical practice settings. SPHTM Requirements and Competencies In addition to completing their School of Medicine curriculum, MD/MPH combined degree students must also complete the following requirements: Required core and programmatic courses in the School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine (SPHTM) Practicum (fulfilled, in part, with MD/MPH rotation) Culminating experience. All MD/MPH students are required to complete a culminating experience which requires students to synthesize and integrate knowledge acquired in coursework and other learning experiences. Your culminating experience should demonstrate to your public health advisor that you have mastered the body of knowledge and can demonstrate proficiency in core and departmental competencies. Additional departmental requirements: each department has specific requirements for programmatic and elective courses and the culminating experience. In some cases, departments may have additional requirements that students should verify with their SPHTM department. Students should verify all requirements with their SPHTM department and should make contact with their advisors each semester to verify their progress toward their degrees. MD/MPH competencies for each department mirror that department's general competencies, which are available at the following links: Epidemiology - MPH in Epidemiology competencies Global Biostatistics and Data Science - MSPH in Biostatistics competencies Global Community Health and Behavioral Science - MPH in Community Health Sciences competencies Environmental Health Sciences - MPH in Disaster Management competencies Health Management and Policy - MPH in Health Systems Management competencies Tropical Medicine - MPH&TM competencies SOM Requirements MD Requirements Courses in the School of Medicine that provide public health content and that MD/MPH combined degree students are required to take include the following: Foundations in Medicine I & II Family and Community Medicine clerkship MD/MPH one-month rotation (3rd or 4th year) Medical microbiology Genetics Clinical diagnosis (evidence-based medicine) Any changes in the School of Medicine curriculum that reduce the public health content courses may require that MD/MPH combined degree students complete additional credit hours in the School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine to meet degree requirements.\n",

Students graduating after 2021 are advised that the Curriculum Committee may further reduce the maximum number of online electives that T4s may complete. PhD Curriculum In the first two semesters, all students take the identical core curriculum, described below. In conjunction with the course work in the first year, students rotate in 6-week blocks through three of the Program’s participating research laboratories of the student’s choice. This allows students to become more familiar with BMS research and faculty. Students should choose a Dissertation Advisor by the end of the second semester but must choose a Dissertation Advisor by the end of the third semester. Students may choose to further specify their study by choosing an Area of Research Emphasis (a Departmental Track in Anatomy, Biochemistry, Medical Genetics and Genomics, Microbiology and Immunology, Pathology, Pharmacology or Physiology). An area of research emphasis may add further course requirements beyond those required for the Biomedical Sciences PhD degree without specialization.

A minimum of 48 credit hours of course work and independent study is required for the PhD. All formal course work is to be completed within the first two years. Students may take Independent Study ( BMSP 7990 Independent Study (1-6 c.h.) or equivalent) for 1-6 credits per semester for a maximum of 12 credits total during the first two years. The remaining hours of coursework are selected from the elective curriculum by the student in consultation with the dissertation advisor.  Once coursework is completed, the student must demonstrate the ability to carry out independent study and research in a chosen field, as evidenced in the dissertation. Students ordinarily complete the requirements for the Ph.D. degree between four and seven years from the date of matriculation in the program. Physician/Scientist Program Requirements Medical School- Years 1 & 2 Our medical school first and second year curriculum provides the necessary foundation for graduates to be well prepared to enter any field of medicine. Emphasis has been placed on self-directed learning, integration of basic and clinical sciences, and more active forms of learning. Students’ medical careers begin with the White Coat Ceremony, which defines the commitment and dedication they have made to their patients and themselves as they enter medical school. Students learn basic science knowledge during the first two years in lectures, problem-based learning sessions, small group discussions, laboratories, and clinical correlations. In mid-June of the second year, students sit for Step 1 of the USMLE. Graduate School P/SP students enter the graduate years full-time after completing Step 1 of the USMLE. Students may elect to do a third research rotation, or if they have already completed two research rotations, may select a graduate program and a dissertation advisor, and begin work on their Ph.D. dissertation. Coursework during the graduate years emphasizes basic principles and concepts in biochemistry, biostatistics, genetics, and cell biology, with additional courses specific to the area of concentration. Additional program requirements include weekly seminar series, and student research presentations. All students take a online course in ethics and must complete a proposal-based Preliminary Examination, usually after the first year of graduate school. When the dissertation advisory committee is satisfied that the aims of the research project have been met and the dissertation has been defended successfully, the requirements for the Ph.D. will have been completed. P/SP students prepare to re-enter medical school as they near completion of their dissertation. Typically students begin medical school in July or mid-August with the third year medical student class. Students anticipating return to medical school notify the medical school in January and complete the clerkship selection process, which is coordinated by the Office of Student Affairs of the medical school. Up to 24 credit hours of coursework is transferred from the students’ medical school. Medical School - Years 3 & 4 P/SP students begin third year medical school clerkships about July 1 of their seventh year, after completing their Ph.D. dissertation. The majority of clinical training is offered in the third and fourth years. Tulane has created a “combined” third and fourth year, whereby students have 20 months of training, of which 15 are required and 5 are elective. The requirements for the third and fourth year include: 8-week clerkships in internal medicine, surgery, pediatrics, obstetrics/gynecology, and psychiatry/neurology, a 6 week clerkship in family medicine, 2 weeks of radiology, emergency medicine, and outpatient surgery, and 5 one month electives, one month of ambulatory internal medicine, and a sub-internship. Students are also required to participate in a new interdisciplinary seminar series in which students choose from a variety of offerings. The entire family medicine clerkship is an ambulatory based experience with a community preceptor, most of whom practice in rural settings. The medicine and surgery clerkships are in-patient experiences, while the other clerkships offer a balance of inpatient and outpatient experience Physician/Scientist Program Curriculum Medical School- Years 1 & 2 Our medical school first and second year curriculum provides the necessary foundation for graduates to be well prepared to enter any field of medicine.

The entire family medicine clerkship is an ambulatory based experience with a community preceptor, most of whom practice in rural settings. The medicine and surgery clerkships are in-patient experiences, while the other clerkships offer a balance of inpatient and outpatient experience Physician/Scientist Program Curriculum Medical School- Years 1 & 2 Our medical school first and second year curriculum provides the necessary foundation for graduates to be well prepared to enter any field of medicine. Emphasis has been placed on self-directed learning, integration of basic and clinical sciences, and more active forms of learning. Students’ medical careers begin with the White Coat Ceremony, which defines the commitment and dedication they have made to their patients and themselves as they enter medical school. Students learn basic science knowledge during the first two years in lectures, problem-based learning sessions, small group discussions, laboratories, and clinical correlations. In mid-June of the second year, students sit for Step 1 of the USMLE. Graduate School P/SP students enter the graduate years full-time after completing Step 1 of the USMLE. Students may elect to do a third research rotation, or if they have already completed two research rotations, may select a graduate program and a dissertation advisor, and begin work on their Ph.D. dissertation. Coursework during the graduate years emphasizes basic principles and concepts in biochemistry, biostatistics, genetics, and cell biology, with additional courses specific to the area of concentration. Additional program requirements include weekly seminar series, and student research presentations. All students take a online course in ethics and must complete a proposal-based Preliminary Examination, usually after the first year of graduate school. When the dissertation advisory committee is satisfied that the aims of the research project have been met and the dissertation has been defended successfully, the requirements for the Ph.D. will have been completed. P/SP students prepare to re-enter medical school as they near completion of their dissertation. Typically students begin medical school in July or mid-August with the third year medical student class. Students anticipating return to medical school notify the medical school in January and complete the clerkship selection process, which is coordinated by the Office of Student Affairs of the medical school. The complete graduate program guidelines are as follows: Up to 24 credit hours of coursework is transferred from the students’ medical school. First Year Fall: BMSP 7100 Workshop (1 credit) BMSP 7140 Seminar (1 credit) BMSP 7990 Independent Study (4-6 credits depending upon elective chosen) Elective Courses Attend BMS Retreat (no credits) Safety Training (no credits) Spring: GBCH 7250 Biostatistics (2 credits) BMSP 7110 Workshop (1 credit) BMSP 7150 Seminar (1 credit) BMSP 7990 Independent Study (2-4 credits depending upon elective chosen) Elective Course Transfer from Medical School (24 credits) Second Year The second year consists of only Workshop (BMSP 7100 - 1credit/semester) and Seminar (BMSP 7140 1 credit/semester) to complete a total of 48 credit hours. Students must also register for Independent Study (BMSP 7990) or Selected topics (BMSP 7500) to maintain full time status. Second year will have no other formal didactic courses.  However, if a student chooses a mentor within a specific area of research emphasis, further requirements may be necessary. Medical School- Years 3 & 4 P/SP students begin third year medical school clerkships about July 1 of their seventh year, after completing their Ph.D. dissertation. The majority of clinical training is offered in the third and fourth years. Tulane has created a “combined” third and fourth year, whereby students have 20 months of training, of which 15 are required and 5 are elective. The requirements for the third and fourth year include: 8-week clerkships in internal medicine, surgery, pediatrics, obstetrics/gynecology, and psychiatry/neurology, a 6 week clerkship in family medicine, 2 weeks of radiology, emergency medicine, and outpatient surgery, and 5 one month electives, one month of ambulatory internal medicine, and a sub-internship.

Required Courses Fall semester: MIIM-7500 Graduate Medical Microbiology (4 credits). This course is designed to introduce graduate students to bacterial, fungal and viral pathogens that are the etiological agents of the most significant infectious diseases worldwide. The course will focus on the basic mechanisms of microbial pathogenesis with emphasis on the host-microbe interactions and the most recent advances on therapeutic and prophylactic treatments to combat these diseases. Important historical discoveries along with current scientific strategies to study the molecular basis of virulence will be discussed, and recent high impact publications will be assigned for reading and discussion. Course Director: Dr. Lucy Freytag. MIIM-7600 Medical Immunology (3 credits). This course is designed to provide a basis of terminology relevant to the basic concepts of immunology. It commences with the important components (cell, tissues; antibodies; immunoglobulins) involved in host defense against infectious agents. Introductory lectures serve to describe and differentiate between natural defense (innate) mechanisms and adaptive immunity mediated by functional B and T lymphocytes and their products. Subsequently, cellular interactions, especially the differentiation of helper T cells subsets and the production of relevant cytokines, will be described. This will include the mechanisms of T cell activation and regulation. Finally, clinical immunology will be discussed: autoimmunity and autoimmune diseases; hypersensitivity reactions, including atopic disorders and asthma; mechanisms of transplant rejection; and immunodeficiency disorders. Course Director: Dr. Mairi Noverr. MIIM-7550 Microbiology Lab (3 credits). This course is designed to teach students how to perform basic laboratory tests using simple diagnostic tests for infectious diseases techniques. The bulk of the course consists of hands-on laboratory experience conducting laboratory tests with simulated clinical specimens and analyzing prepared teaching specimens. Procedures for organism isolation and identification and rapid diagnostic kits will be covered. Course Director: Dr. Louise Lawson. MIIM-7010 Seminar In Microbiology (1 credit). The main purpose of the Seminar is to provide students with the opportunity to develop the confidence and skills necessary to make successful scientific presentations, enhance their critical thinking, and engage in thoughtful and productive scientific discussions with their professors and peers.

      "The Ph.D. Degree (Standard track and Moral Philosophy track) has three components: Satisfactory completion of 48 hours (16 courses) of coursework in accordance with departmental distribution requirements (see below). Submission of one satisfactory Qualifying Paper. Students are subject to dismissal should the qualifying paper be deemed unacceptable. Presentation and defense of a Doctoral Thesis. Students in the PhD program must submit all materials for any incomplete class grades by September 1 of the following year. For example, materials for any incomplete from courses during the 2019-2020 academic year would have to be submitted by September 1, 2020. Students in the PhD program are subject to an annual review, described below. Deadlines for the Qualifying Paper and Dissertation Progress are described below. No student may miss a deadline without a strong excuse presented to the Director of Graduate Studies (such as a documented medical or family emergency). A failure to meet one of these deadlines is cause to bring the issue of the student’s performance before the department as a whole. Distribution Requirement for Coursework (Standard Track) The distribution requirement for coursework in the Standard track is as follows. Students must take at least one course in three of the following areas: Metaphysics Epistemology Philosophy of Mind Philosophy of Language Philosophy of Science In addition, students are required to take three courses in the history of philosophy (at least one in Ancient as well as one in Modern), one course in Moral/Political/Legal Philosophy and one in Logic. The distribution requirement in Logic may be waived if a student demonstrates graduate-level competence by passing an examination in this subject after joining the program. Of the remaining eight courses, two may be taken in another department, with approval of the Philosophy Department Graduate Studies Committee. Distribution Requirement for Coursework (Moral Philosophy Track) The distribution requirement for coursework in the specialty track in Moral Philosophy is as follows. Students must take at least one course in three of the following areas: Metaphysics Epistemology Philosophy of Mind Philosophy of Language Philosophy of Science In addition, students are required to take three courses in the history of philosophy (at least one being the History of Ethics or the History of Political Philosophy), and one in Formal Methods (which may include logic, game theory, rational choice theory, or another course in the methodological tools relevant to the student's philosophical work). The distribution requirement in Formal Methods may be waived if a student demonstrates graduate-level competence by passing an examination in this subject after joining the program. Of the remaining nine courses, six must be in moral and political philosophy, with at least one course each from four of the following subdisciplines: Political Philosophy Philosophy of Law Moral Psychology Agency and Responsibility Metaethics Normative Ethics Applied Ethics Feminist Ethics Two of these courses may be taken in another department, with approval of the Philosophy Department Graduate Studies Committee. Students in this track are also expected to attend and participate regularly in Murphy Institute seminars and lectures in moral philosophy. The Qualifying Paper Purpose of the Qualifying Paper The purpose of the project is to evaluate the student's ability to produce a \"professional\" quality paper. The paper may be the result of reworking a term paper from a course.Students are encouraged but not required to write the qualifying paper on the topic of their dissertation. The paper must represent new work written by the student. It is not allowed, for instance, simply to submit a previous MA thesis. Any old work must be substantially revised. Quality Students are subject to dismissal should the Qualifying Paper be deemed unacceptable. It is therefore important to approach the task of writing this paper with a sense of the quality of work that is expected and how this may be achieved. The qualifying paper should provide strong evidence that the student is willing and able to produce publishable work. An acceptable paper will demonstrate ability to engage your own philosophical thinking in relation to the relevant literature and competence with that literature. This might be achieved by: Presenting an argument dialectically among several writers and entering the discussion with your own view. Providing an illuminating account of a philosopher's argument(s) or contention(s) Interpreting a philosophic text in order to bring to light its argument or teaching Tracing the historical development of an idea that you analyze and evaluate It is not acceptable to: Simply review several books or articles on a given topic Present different philosopher's claims or arguments and merely opt for one of them. The Committee The Qualifying Paper is evaluated by a committee consisting of three faculty members. The Director will be a faculty member agreed upon by the student, the Director of Graduate Studies (DGS), and the faculty member. The Second and Third Reader on the Committee will be assigned by the DGS in consultation with the Director. The student is advised to make arrangements with the director of the paper about how the interchange between them shall work out as the composition of the paper progresses. Different professors may wish to do this in different ways. A general understanding between director and student should be reached before the summer vacation that precedes the year in which semester in which the paper is due. With the approval of the director, topics may be modified or changed. Deadlines The day two weeks before the last day of Spring semester classes is the target date for submitting a proposal for the Qualifying Paper to the DGS. For example, if the Qualifying Paper is due on October 1, 2019, the student should submit a proposal two weeks before the end of the Spring 2020 semester. The proposal should include a brief description of the project (at least several lines) and the name of the faculty member who has agreed to serve as director. The Qualifying Paper must be submitted by October 1 during the student's third year (or second year if the student entered with a transferable MA degree). It is expected that one or more drafts of the paper would have been submitted before the deadline and the final version would reflect responses to comments from members of the committee. Evaluation The members of the committee will evaluate the paper and independently submit to the DGS a judgment on it, with comments and justification for the judgment. Faculty must report grades for the Qualifying paper by November 15. The original submission will be evaluated as \"Pass,\" \"Fail,\" or \"Revise and Resubmit.\" Two \"Fail\" votes on the original submission results in a failed paper. Only one \"Revise and Resubmit\" or \"Fail\" vote is needed to force revisions, and in that case, the revised paper will be due on February 1. After that date a majority vote will decide whether the paper passes or fails. The final grade for the Qualifying Paper must be submitted by the faculty members by March 1. A failed paper will result in dismissal from the doctoral program, subject to a review by the whole department. The faculty committee members may not inform the student of his/her evaluation until the Director of Graduate Studies or the Philosophy Department faculty releases the information. The Dissertation Students should complete an \"Admission to Candidacy\" form to the DGS after completing all requirements but the dissertation. Students should seek a dissertation supervisor and in consultation with that professor form a committee with two other faculty members. Students must submit to the DGS the dissertation prospectus, along with a “Dissertation Prospectus Approval” form by October 1 of the 4th year (3rd year if the student entered with a transferable MA degree). Students must submit to the DGS a dissertation chapter that shows significant progress beyond the Qualifying Paper by February 1 of the 4th year (3rd year if the student entered with a transferable MA degree). Students must submit to the DGS an additional dissertation chapter that is different from the first one by February 1 of the 5th year (4th year if the student entered with a transferable MA degree). For more information about graduation requirements see the Dissertation Guidelines at the Tulane Graduate Studies website. Annual Review The Department will conduct an annual review at which faculty members review the progress of graduate students. The meeting will be held during the spring semester, typically around March 1, and at the meeting a warning might be issued to a student to either end funding or terminate a student from the program. A student will be automatically dismissed from the program, subject to a review by the whole department, if he or she failed the qualifying paper, has a preponderance of B grades (or lower), has two B- grades (or lower), or a C+ grade (or lower) in their classes. In addition, the department can vote to warn the student that funding will be terminated or the student will be dismissed from the program if – among other possible reasons – the student has three or more B grades (or lower), misses one of the deadlines stated above, has a weak qualifying paper, or shows insufficient progress in his or her dissertation. The department has to state the cause for concern in the warning letter, and after being warned, students would have a semester to markedly improve their performance as well as present any evidence that might put their performance in a different light. Without this, the initial department vote would take effect after the semester is over, and either the funding would be terminated, or the student would be dismissed from the program. Progress Requirements for Students Receiving External Fellowships Students on a fellowship or leave for a year must show substantial evidence of work they have completed. This would typically be two chapters of the dissertation, or one chapter along with papers for publication or presentation, which should be submitted to the dissertation Director and Graduate Director. Further support in the program, such as continuation of the graduate stipend or adjunct teaching, will depend on meeting this requirement.

      "Major: Physics Major - Requirements Content\n",
      "General Course Requirements for Physics The intention of Tulane's physics major program is to encourage students to continue on to graduate education in Physics and related disciplines or to pursue cross-disciplinary preparation in physics for medical or other professional schools. Dual majors are encouraged, however students may not major in both Physics and Engineering Physics due to the substantial overlap. Students pursuing a career in physics are advised to follow the \"Pre-Graduate Training\" sequence. The minimum GPA for degree certification, counting all courses pertaining to Physics, Mathematics, and approved Science and Engineering electives, is 2.50. The basic requirements for a Physics Major are as follows: Course List Course ID Title Credits Select at least four courses of mathematics 1 13 Required Physics Courses 18 PHYS 1310 General Physics I 4 PHYS 1320 General Physics II 4 PHYS 2350 Modern Physics I 3 PHYS 2360 Modern Physics II 3 PHYS 3530 Advanced Laboratory 3 PHYS 3800 Physics Colloquium 1 Four Physics Electives 12 Select two  of the following: 6 PHYS 3010 Theoretical Physics 3 PHYS 3630 Electromagnetic Theory 3 PHYS 3740 Classical Mechanics 3 PHYS 4230 Thermal Physics 3 PHYS 4470 Intro Quantum Mechanics 3 PHYS 4650 Optics 3 Select two additional 3-credit PHYS courses at the 2000 level or higher 6 Additional Electives 15 Select five 3-credit elective courses in Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Computer Science, or Engineering. The courses must be at the 2000 level or higher, with exceptions noted in the footnote. One of these five electives must be a computational course. 2 15 1 At least two courses at the 2000-level or above. 2 The five elective courses must be at or above the 2000 level, with the exception of CHEM 1070+1075, CHEM 1080+1085, CMPS 1500, and CMPS 1600. Students should always confirm with the Major Advisor that all their electives are acceptable. Notes: Students are encouraged to consider a bachelor of science in physics as preparation for graduate study in disciplinary and interdisciplinary sciences (physics, astrophysics, biophysics, chemistry, neuroscience, materials science, geophysics, meteorology, oceanography, and applied physics), for professional study in medicine, patent law, business, or engineering, and for careers in environmental science, in mathematical or computer modeling, in science writing, or in science and public policy. Within the requirements above, programs can be tailored to suit the needs of students who elect these career options. In addition, the department offers a 4+1 program that allows students to obtain a Master's Degree in five years, by enabling them to take graduate level courses as an undergraduate. Tulane University is a member of the Oak Ridge Associated Universities (ORAU) consortium. Research opportunities are often available for undergraduate Physics majors in conjunction with faculty, on a case by case basis. Students are responsible for fulfilling all TIDES, cultural knowledge, foreign language, writing, service learning, and other requirements, required by Tulane and the School of Science and Engineering. Sample Schedule of Classes for Physics (This is only a suggested schedule and students should not feel compelled in any way to model their course of studies on this example. Many other options and alternatives are possible, especially when including a double major. Chemistry, for example, is not a requirement for the B.S. in Physics. The illustration of certain courses in certain semesters below does not guarantee they will be offered in the suggested semester. Many physics courses at the 3000-level and above are given only once every two years. Students should keep abreast of actual course offerings as they are published by the Registrar.)

      "Major: Physics, MS - Requirements Content\n",
      "The MS requires 24 hours of physics coursework at the graduate (6000-7000) level plus six additional hours of either graduate courses or research. In the 4+1 program, a student will normally take a total of twelve hours of graduate courses as a junior or senior and nine more hours each semester in the fifth year. This provides a total of thirty hours, including up to six hours of research credit. With permission of the graduate advisor, graduate courses in other departments ( e.g. Chemistry, Computational Science, Math, Engineering) may count toward the MS. A 4+1 student should begin the program in their junior year. While it may be possible to complete the requirements for the 4+1 program by starting in the senior year, this is difficult and not recommended. Please note that some graduate courses are co-taught with similar undergraduate courses and have somewhat different requirements. Application: Application may be made using the standard form for graduate admission available on the SSE website ( https://sse.tulane.edu/academics/graduate/admissions ). Normally an undergraduate GPA of 3.0 or higher, overall and in physics courses, is required for admission. One letter of recommendation is required. The GRE is not required.\n",

One of the electives must be a computational course (PHYS 6170 Computational Physics and Engineering, MPEN 6290 Computational Materials Science and Engineering, or a computational course in another department approved by the graduate program advisor). Up to 6 credits may be fulfilled by Advanced Research I and II, with approval of the research supervisor and graduate program advisor. Advanced Research I and II may be taken at the same time as Research I-IV, with up to 6 credits of research allowed in one semester. Grades Per the SSE Handbook: “A course in which a grade of C+ or less is earned cannot be counted toward a graduate degree. If a student receives one B- grade, the student is immediately considered for probation by the Associate Dean for Graduate Studies in consultation with the appropriate department/program. If a student receives two grades of B-, or one grade less than B-, during his/her tenure in the School of Science and Engineering, the student is placed on probation and considered for dismissal by the Associate Dean in consultation with the appropriate department/program.” A student who does not maintain the minimum 3.0 GPA in graduate course work will be subject to disenrollment. Written Qualifying Exam The Ph.D. qualifying exam is a 6-hour written examination covering classical and modern physics, given by the department once per semester. It covers the typical U.S. undergraduate physics curriculum with an emphasis on classical electrodynamics and quantum mechanics. The qualifying exam must be attempted no later than the fourth semester of graduate study. Students who are sufficiently prepared may take it during the first year with approval of the research supervisor. The passing score is 60%. Students who fail the qualifying exam must retake it until passed. Students may attempt the qualifying exam up to three times. Any student who has not passed the qualifying exam by the end of the fifth semester of graduate study will be disenrolled from the program. Students who have met course requirements and passed the qualifying exam may apply to become degree candidates. Faculty Dissertation Committee Prior to the prospectus defense, the student and research supervisor form the faculty dissertation committee, which consists of the research supervisor (chair) and at least two other faculty members. One member may be from another Tulane department or other appropriate institution. The faculty dissertation committee (henceforth the committee) examines the student at the prospectus defense and oral dissertation defense, and approves the final written dissertation. Prospectus Defense The prospectus defense demonstrates to the committee that the student has acquired sufficient knowledge in the specific research area and can effectively express that knowledge orally and in writing. A student must pass the written qualifying exam before undertaking the prospectus defense. The prospectus defense consists of a written proposal and an oral defense: The written research proposal (10-15 pages) contains an introduction, proposed research and justification, methods, preliminary results, and discussion. It must be reviewed and approved by the committee before the end of the sixth semester of graduate study. The oral defense is a two-hour oral examination, including a research presentation (about 45 minutes) prepared by the student, given by the committee. The examination includes specific questions about the student's research as well as broadly focused questions on the general area of research. The oral defense must be attempted following approval of the written proposal, no later than the sixth semester of graduate study. If failed, the student is normally given a second attempt in the following semester. After two failures the student will be disenrolled from the program (exceptions due to extenuating circumstances may be granted by vote of the faculty). Students who are sufficiently prepared are strongly encouraged to take the prospectus defense before the end of the 4th semester of graduate study. It is expected that, after completion of the oral prospectus defense, the Ph.D. candidate will obtain a Research Assistantship (RA) in the same research group. In order to encourage this, the faculty have adopted a policy for allocating graduate students on TA's to research groups. Annual Report In April of each year, every Ph.D. student will submit a brief annual progress report (1-2 pages) to the research supervisor (and committee, when formed) summarizing research progress and accomplishments over the previous year, and future plans and milestones. This requirement is waived in the years when the prospectus and thesis defenses are completed. Dissertation The final requirement for the Ph.D. degree is a written dissertation based on original research, approved by the committee, and its defense in an oral exam by the committee. Master's Degree The master's degree is not a requirement for the Ph.D. in physics. Admission with financial aid is only for doctoral students. However a graduate student may receive an M.S. in Physics based on 30 hours of approved graduate credit, or (if the research supervisor agrees to offer this option) an M.S. in Physics based on 24 hours of approved graduate credit plus a thesis deemed acceptable by the research supervisor. Research course credit does not count toward the M.S. in Physics degree. Program Transfers Students in the Physics Ph.D. program cannot transfer to the Materials Physics and Engineering Ph.D. program without going through the regular admissions process. Exceptions to the requirements, due to extenuating circumstances, may be granted by vote of the PEP faculty. The Physics program requirements were last modified in Fall 2018. The requirements for students matriculating prior to Fall 2018 may be found here .\n",

      "Tulane requires 48 credit hours of graduate coursework (typically comprised of 16 courses each carrying 3 credit hours) over the course of four semesters as part of the Ph.D. requirements. For students entering with a Master’s degree, the RCSE graduate committee may approve up to 24 credits of graduate coursework toward the Ph.D. total—this classwork can be earned in SSE or externally.  To maintain maximum flexibility in tailoring an interdisciplinary program to the RCSE Ph.D. student, required coursework will be limited to research and writing skill augmentation, as well as typical registration (e.g., dissertation research) required when a student reaches candidacy. To support this tailored program and to rapidly transition decision-making away from the RCSE graduate committee in these matters, we have chosen to institute a very early dissertation committee composition (end of the first semester of matriculation). The Ph.D. student will be required to submit a full program of study (including classwork) approved by their dissertation committee to the RCSE graduate committee by the end of the 2nd full semester of matriculation. PhD students can transfer up to 24 credit hours from previous graduate-level coursework to the degree. The RCSE Graduate Advisor and Department Chair must approve all transfer credits. Students hoping to transfer graduate credits should prepare and submit the paperwork at the start of their second semester at Tulane. SSE will only transfer credits when the student has completed one semester (it is at that point that a Tulane transcript is available). RCSE Ph.D. students will be anticipated to be supported through fellowship, scholarship, or other of the various kinds of assistantships.  Hence, they will be required under SSE rules to be registered for at least nine hours of graduate credit until admitted to candidacy to maintain full-time residence status. These nine hours of graduate credit, following SSE standards, may be a combination of course work and research or solely research credit. Approved academic graduate electives from other departments can be applied to the degree up to a limit of 12 credit hours.  All other courses must originate from RCSE.  If a class is not on the approved list, a student may petition the Graduate Advisor for it to be accepted as an elective. Note that Ph.D. students must register for credits during the summer due to health insurance reasons Unless students have been exposed previously to the material offered, thesis committees will strongly urge students to take two introductory technical course offered by RCSE—the existing RCSE 6800 Introduction to River Science and Engineering, and RCSE 6802 Introduction to Coastal Science and Engineering.

Note that if all other credit requirements are met, the student can enroll in ONLY 3 hrs of Masters Research to maintain enrollment, i.e. this maintains full time enrollment. PhD students must undertake a general (preliminary or qualifying) examination by the beginning of the third academic year of study (5 th semester).  Following SSE guidelines, a student who fails to take the test within a reasonable length of time will be judged not to be making adequate progress towards the degree and will be advised by RCSE not to continue graduate study.  Prior to scheduling the examination, the student will give an in person preliminary dissertation prospectus presentation to their committee where they outline the proposed topic of original research, a background of the state of knowledge of the topic, and the progress to date in their work. Following successful completion of the oral qualifying examination, the student will prepare a dissertation prospectus that focuses on the individual novel research projects that will result in dissertation chapters and eventual peer-reviewed publications. This document will be approved by the dissertation committee for submission to SSE, at which point the student will be advanced to candidacy.  Preliminary drafts of this prospectus will be produced in the required RCSE 7020 Technical Writing course. At the time of submission of dissertation for approval by the committee, a Ph.D. student will be required to have submitted at least one, and preferably two manuscripts for peer-reviewed publication as supervised by their dissertation committee.\n",

Immersion As part of the DSW curriculum students will complete a 4 day immersion project in New Orleans, Louisiana.  The academic residency will occur during the summer semester and provides an opportunity to network with fellow students and faculty. The residency experience is designed to emphasize applied learning and identifying program outcomes in partnership with a local social service agency.  Students will require skills useful in conducting action research with community organizations and further develop a critical frame for designing real world program and clinical evaluations. The immersion program will also provide an opportunity to identify program evaluation or action research questions consistent with their Advanced Practice Project and further develop their APP proposal. Advanced Practice Project Students are encouraged to develop a possible topic for their advanced practice project early in their doctoral study. Once a topic has been selected, a three-member committee will review a formal proposal and provide feedback to the student. Final approval of the proposal as fulfillment of a requirement for candidacy for the degree is granted only upon fulfillment of all other requirements for candidacy, including 56 hours of required courses and successful defense of the proposed project. Program Faculty DSW courses are by Tulane School of Social Work professors and visiting faculty from a variety of social science disciplines, including social work, sociology, urban studies and psychology.

The courses for which the student will serve as a TA must be approved by the PhD advisor. Comprehensive Exams On completion of the coursework listed above, students will be required to pass a comprehensive examination to demonstrate doctoral program competencies as well as knowledge related to their content area of expertise. Prospectus After passing the comprehensive exam a student must defend their prospectus. Upon agreement of all committee members, a student will defend the prospectus in an oral exam which is open to the school. Students need to follow  all deadlines and submit all forms as specified in the school PhD handbook. Dissertation PhD students must complete a dissertation that has a strong basic social science or natural science research focus, and make a unique and original contribution to the scientific literature. The dissertation should help the student prepare for a career in research through demonstrated excellence in the research methods that are used. Consistent with the purpose of the PhD program, dissertations should go beyond basic descriptive analyses of existing data sets (through novel theoretical or methodological applications are acceptable); and have greater innovation and significance than just monitoring and evaluation of an existing project.\n",

Students should take advanced elective courses that complement their research area and are consistent with the PhD program objectives. Courses taken outside of the SPHTM need approval from the advisor to confirm such an elective course would be relevant to knowledge required for successful completion of the dissertation research project. Infectious Disease Seminar Students must enroll twice in TRMD 7020 Infectious Disease Seminar for 1-credit each time (for a total of 2 credits). After fulfilling the 2 credits of seminar, students must enroll in 0-credit versions of either TRMD 7020 Infectious Disease Seminar or TRMD 7000 Tropical Medicine Seminar each semester until the comprehensive examination is completed. Research Rotations Doctoral students are required to enroll in TRMD 8100 Laboratory Rotation as part of their research training at least once. They may enroll up to two more times with different faculty as an elective course. The rotations will acquaint the student with different research programs available in the department and assist the student in choosing a permanent dissertation advisor. In addition, by rotating with other faculty members the student will obtain research experience and training in different specialized areas. Research Ethics Students are required to take online research ethics training via CITI or another equivalent training program in research ethics. PhD students in Tropical Medicine fulfill this requirement with INTD 6010 – Responsible Conduct of Research (RCR). This seminar series satisfies the responsible conduct of research training requirements of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the National Science Foundation (NSF). This certification must remain current throughout the program duration and at a frequency of no less than once every four years. Teaching Assistant Experience All PhD students at SPHTM are required to serve as a teaching assistant (TA) for two SPHTM graduate courses while enrolled in the PhD program.  Students should register for Teaching Assistantship Educational Experience (0 credits) during the terms they complete each TA requirement. The courses for which the student will serve as a TA must be approved by the faculty advisor. SPHL 9970 – Dissertation Research Doctoral students who have completed required doctoral course work but have not defended their prospectus are required to register for (SPHL 9970) Dissertation Research each semester to maintain continuous registration in the PhD program. SPHL 9990 – Dissertation Doctoral candidates who have defended their prospectus and are engaged in research are required to register for (SPHL 9990) Dissertation each semester until the degree is awarded. Comprehensive Exam Upon completion of required coursework, students are expected to develop a research question outside of the focus of their dissertation work and write and defend their work orally before a faculty committee chosen in consultation with the PhD Program Director. The purpose of the comprehensive examination is to ensure that candidates for the PhD degree can organize a clear plan of research around a problem different from their proposed thesis. Prospectus After passing the comprehensive exam the student along with their advisor will choose a prospectus dissertation committee and prepare and defend a prospectus of proposed research, ideally within 6 months after successful completion of the comprehensive examination. The committee must include a minimum of three members with at least two faculty from the Department of Tropical Medicine and one external to SPHTM. The research prospectus must be presented and defended at least one semester before the dissertation defense. Following the successful defense of the prospectus, students are admitted to PhD candidacy and proceed with dissertation research. Dissertation Students must conduct original public health research and defend a dissertation based on that research. The dissertation research demonstrates scholarly work and is the basis for the dissertation. The dissertation committee and SPHTM Executive Faculty approve the dissertation. In addition to SPHTM dissertation requirements for the PhD, the dissertation must meet the requirements for a PhD dissertation in Tropical Medicine.

    "DATA 1010Introduction to Data(3)DATA 1010aims to provide students with an overview to what data is, how it is used correctly and incorrectly, how it is found, stored, and managed, and how it can be used as a basis for decision making and analysis. The overall goal of this course is to increase data literacy, such that students are more confidently able to work with the increasing amounts of data in their lives, jobs, and academic careers. This course is aimed towards students in all schools and fields and has no prerequisites.DATA 1940Transfer Course Work(0-4)Transfer CourseworkMaximum Hours:99DATA 2020Data Analysis(3)This course provides an overview of the statistical tools most commonly used to analyze quantitative data. Topics include describing data, statistical inference, statistical significance, hypothesis testing, and regression analyses. The course focuses on understanding how to use appropriate analytical techniques and interpret the results of statistical analyses for variables with different levels of measurement. For each topic area, the methodology, including the underlying theory, assumptions, and mechanics of how each analytical tool works, is discussed, along with the appropriate interpretation of results. Concepts are presented in the context of real-world examples using publicly available data sets. The course will also introduce students to statistical software. Students of all skill levels are welcome, including those with limited or no statistical, mathematical, or programming backgrounds. All data analysis skills will be taught in class.DATA 2030Data Visualization(3)Students will examine different creative and analytical theories and techniques for understanding and developing data visualizations, including maps, graphs, charts, and interactive tools such as dashboards. Students will access and clean data for visualizing potential, analyze data visualizations for bias and persuasive intent, and create data visualizations to communicate findings and tell engaging stories for diverse audiences. Students will also consider the societal role that data visualizations play in validating knowledge while exploring ethical concerns and critiques around communicating arguments visually. As practice, students will storyboard, create, peer review, and justify design choices when using a variety of open-source data visualizations. Students of all skill levels are welcome, and all data visualization skills will be taught in class.DATA 2150Applied Generative AI(3)The introduction of widely available and accessible generative Artificial Intelligence tools, such as ChatGPT, democratizes expertise, unlocks knowledge, and bestows impressive abilities. This hands-on course provides students with practical experience employing generative AI to perform real-world tasks.
