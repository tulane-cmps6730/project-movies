CMPS 4760Distributed Systems(3)This course covers the fundamental concepts in distributed computing. The objective is to introduce students to the core notions, algorithms, and analytic tools in the design of distributed systems. Recent developments in peer-to-peer systems, cloud computing, sensor networks, etc. will be used as case studies to help students establish a firm understanding of the philosophy and pitfalls in the design of computer systems when there is no global clock and when unpredictable failures and variable latency are the norm.
