HPAM 6550Dynamics of Payment systems - Policy & Function(3)This course introduces students to the ways providers of health care services have been, are, and will be paid for the services by private-sector payers and public-sector programs.

Topics include (1) the macro-economic environment within which current payment systems have evolved and continue to evolve; (2) payment mechanisms for institutionally based care, both acute and sub-acute, and for ambulatory care over a range of settings; (3) regulatory processes determining payment for services in entitlement programs; (4) the policy objectives furthered or impeded by public-sector and private-sector payment mechanisms; and (5) analysis of provider responses to payment systems incentives.
