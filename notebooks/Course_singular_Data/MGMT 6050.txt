MGMT 6050Consulting Practicum(3)The Consulting Practicum course is a project-based action-learning semester-long course. In this course, you will put your problem-solving skills from different business disciplines covered in your MBA core coursework into action and synthesize knowledge from different business disciplines to develop strategies and solution approaches to a client company’s business problem. Core course faculty from different business disciplines will oversee and advise small student teams as you put your knowledge and skills to work.
The course will begin with an overview of the best practices in consulting and hands-on consulting skills as your team familiarizes themselves with the client company and its problem. Don’t expect those to be problems with a clear solution or answer, but rather real and messy problems across a range of business disciplines. Your team will develop a report to your client and present project recommendations. This course is designed to provide you with client project experience you can readily leverage to succeed in your summer internship.
