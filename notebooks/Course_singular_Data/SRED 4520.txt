SRED 4520Cities, Disasters & Decisions(3)This course teaches the multi-dimensional determinants of economic decision-making in cities during times of crisis, and offers students a road
map to analyze and evaluate how those decisions relate to recovery outcomes. We will explore how certain cities approached previous catastrophic events and build a “context and factors” database to
understand how specific urban, political, social and economic characteristics of cities interact to result in policy and individual decisions that impact recovery. Prerequisite(s):SRED 2010orRESM 3010.
