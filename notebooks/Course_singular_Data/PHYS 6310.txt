PHYS 6310Quantum Optics(3)Quantum optics is an emerging field of physics that involves the study of semi-classical and quantum-mechanical models of the electromagnetic field, as well as its interaction with atoms and molecules.  These nonclassical and quantum features of light have been shown to break the barriers imposed by classical physics in a variety of fields, such as communication, interferometry, computation, and imaging.  The main emphasis of this course will be to introduce these nonclassical features, quantize the electromagnetic field, introduce fundamental tests of quantum mechanics by use of optics, and explore the applications of nonclassical concepts such as entanglement.
