CLAS 3180Roman Art & Archaeology(3)The Roman Empire encompassed the entire rim of the Mediterranean Sea and much of western Europe. This course will undertake an intensive analysis of the material culture of ancient Rome through its art and archaeology. In successfully completing the semester, you will gain a thorough knowledge of the art and archaeology of ancient Rome and its world, focusing especially on changes through time and on the political, social, and economic developments that are illuminated by material remains. We will also discuss current issues related to Roman antiquities and the preservation of world cultural heritage. Working together as a class, we will learn how to use the archaeological record to reconstruct the past, while at the same time examining our own culture and its role in human history.
