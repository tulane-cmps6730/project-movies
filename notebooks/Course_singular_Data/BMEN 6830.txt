BMEN 6830Intro Biomed Imaging & Process(3)The objective of this course is to teach graduate students the concepts, algorithms and programming of image analysis techniques and apply them to address real world biomedical imaging challenges. The physics of medical imaging modalities including x-ray, MRI, CT, PET and microscopic imaging will be introduced. The basic underlying mathematical signal processing techniques such as Fourier analysis and linear system theory will be studied to model and process biomedical images. Finally, students will learn how to use MATLAB as a tool and apply the image processing techniques to solve some medical imaging problems such as image enhancement, segmentation and pattern classification.
