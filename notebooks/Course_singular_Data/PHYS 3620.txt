PHYS 3620MicroFab and Nanotech(3)Nano/micro-electromechanical devices (N/MEMS) require knowledge of a broad range of disciplines, from the fundamental physics of mechanics and electromagnetism to practical nano/microfabrication processes and techniques. This course is opened for the introduction of this interdisciplinary engineering field, using examples and design projects drawn from real-word N/MEMS applications. Lectures will cover nano/micro-fabrication technologies, material properties at different scaling, physical principle and behaviors of nano/microstructural behavior, piezoresistive and capacitive sensing, electrostatic actuation, fluid damping, noise, and feedback systems.
