CMPS 1100Foundations of Programming(3)An introductory practice-oriented course on computer programming, in which the students design, implement, test and debug programs for computational problems drawn from various fields using Python programming language, while working individually and in groups. This course emphasizes program design process, object-oriented software development approach, and development of practical programming skills that translate to programming in other modern languages.  This is a stand-alone introductory computer science course that is not a part of the coordinate major in computer science program. It is aimed at students with no prior computing background who wish to learn the foundations of programming and computational problem solving.
