EDUC 6860Teaching Mathematics in ECE(3)This course will prepare prospective teachers to teach mathematics in the early childhood setting (preschool through 3rd grade). This course covers both mathematical content and methods for teaching developmentally appropriate topics in arithmetic, geometry, algebra, probability and statistics, and measurement, data collection and analysis. Emphasis will be placed on developmentally appropriate instruction and active learning strategies, including the use of technology in instruction, and on performance-based assessment. Students work with manipulatives and technology to explore mathematics, solve problems, and learn ways to teach mathematics content to children. Course includes practice in creating and refining age-appropriate unit and lesson plans based on Understanding by Design model (Wiggins & McTighe). For those taking this course at the graduate level, understanding how to cite research and data that support findings will be a key objective. The students will review literature about best mathematical practices, content, and knowledge at a level in which they can teach others. They will complete a course assignment that involves designing a professional development math portfolio as a guide for elementary teachers. The essential elements of instruction, assessment, grouping strategies, and effective questioning techniques will be key components in the portfolio. In addition, the portfolio will explicitly state how to differentiate math instruction to meet the needs of all learners.Prerequisite(s):EDUCÂ 6830.
