GBCH 7330Advanced Bioinformatics(3)The goal of this course is to introduce foundational concepts, algorithms and applications of advanced bioinformatics, particularly machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) in biomedical research. The major topics include machine learning, deep learning, and AI and their state-of-the-art applications in biomedicine. Students will acquire mathematical formulations and computer algorithms in regression modeling, data clustering and dimensionality reduction, data classifications (including deep learning), and reinforcement learning. Students will also gain detailed knowledge and hands-on experience in proteomics) and develop programming skills in applying open-source software programs in analyzing and interpreting omics data. Prerequisite: A Biochemistry course.
