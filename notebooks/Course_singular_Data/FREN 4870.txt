FREN 4870Women Writers of the Arab World(3)This seminar proposes to investigate the ways in which the related discourses of nationalism, Islam and feminism can fruitfully intersect to illuminate the corpus of women’s literature from the former French colonies and Protectorates in the Arab world. With an emphasis on issues of social justice, citizenship, and feminism, both locally and transnationally, we will interrogate the ways in which literature mediates the construction of women as historical subjects.Prerequisite(s):FREN 4010.
