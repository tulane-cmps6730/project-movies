MGMT 7020Impact Capstone(3)The Impact Capstone is a project-based action-learning semester-long course. In this course, you will put your problem-solving skills from different business disciplines across your MBA core courses and MBA leadership module to work to make a difference in the realm of social and/or environmental issues that plague society today. Core course faculty will oversee and advise small student teams as they put their knowledge and skills to work with a local or regional partner.
Projects can be of the following types: 1) Help a local or regional business become more sustainable; 2) Help a local or regional business to alleviate social inequities in the community; or 3) Work with a local non-profit or government organization on bigger questions of sustainability and resiliency in the face of climate change and how climate change impacts the local and regional business environment.Prerequisite(s):
