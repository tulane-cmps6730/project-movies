EMPL 9000Immersion Weekend(0)Students will need to attend at least one Immersion Weekend during their time in the program. These sessions are held every summer, so students can plan to attend during either their first or second year in the program, but the experience of prior students indicates that the session is most beneficial to those who attend in their first year. It is both an academic and networking opportunity for students to meet their classmates, professors, and other professionals working in the area of labor and employment law. The occasion will include a keynote speaker, lectures and workshops from industry experts, and a variety of social activities.
