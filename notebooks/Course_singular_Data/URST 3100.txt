URST 3100Urban Geography(3)Surveys discipline of geography with focus on how various traditions within the discipline analyze cities and other human communities as spatial environments. Students will learn the tools, techniques, and datasets geographers employ to investigate questions pertaining to the shape, form, origins, transformative processes, and interaction of the natural and built environments; how and why phenomena are distributed spatially and through time; the concept and perception of place and how we distinguish places from one another; and how present-day cityscapes reflect these concerns. Lectures will focus on New Orleans but be comparative and students will be required to apply these approaches to other cities and towns.
