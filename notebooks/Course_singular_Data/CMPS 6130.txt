CMPS 6130Intro Comp Geom(3)This course provides an introduction to geometric algorithms and geometric data structures. Computational Geometry is a young discipline which enjoys close relations to mathematics and to various application areas such as geometric databases, molecular biology, sensor networks, visualization, geographic information systems (GIS), VLSI, robotics, computer graphics and geometric modeling. Covered topics include fundamental geometric algorithm design and analysis paradigms, geometric data structures for planar subdivisions and range searching, algorithms to computer the convex hull, Voronoi diagrams, and Delaunay triangulation, as well as selected advanced topics.
