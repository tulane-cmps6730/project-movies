MDES 2110Media Ethics & Equity(3)Studying media ethics is central to understanding the pervasive nature that media play in our lives and the impact that the decisions of media practitioners have on society. Ethics play an integral role in every decision we make – from content creation to audience selection. This course begins with a discussion of traditional moral theory and ethical philosophies and applies them to modern-day issues in 21st century media. Topics include truth in media, privacy, social justice, framing the news and current events, media ownership, stereotyping and representation in film, television and advertising, as well as communications law, the Internet and digital media. Media literacy will be a central theme throughout the course and students will be presented with case studies about events and issues and will examine the decisions and implications on society. Ultimately, students are encouraged to become active users of media and, ultimately, content creators whose diverse, equitable and inclusive lens can create actionable change in society.Prerequisite(s):(MDES 2200and3220).
