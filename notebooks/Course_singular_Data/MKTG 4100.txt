MKTG 4100Consumer Behavior(3)The course covers major concepts and findings in consumer behavior and how these ideas relate to consumer decision-making and consumption choices. The course is focused on understanding the cognitive, emotional, social and contextual factors that govern consumer decision-making. Students debate the efficacy and ethics of marketing actions by brand managers, advertising agencies, public service organizations and policy makers and consumers' reactions to these actions. The course draws substantially on real-world marketing stimuli to illustrate how the success (or failure) of marketing strategies depend on the close correspondence to (or violation of) principles of consumer behavior.
