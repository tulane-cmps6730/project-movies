SCEN 6060Applied Innovation(3)Given a vetted product that solves a real problem, why do some young projects and companies fail, while others thrive and achieve the commercial or societal impact necessary to make a real difference in the world? This course reviews the foundational aspects of applied scientific and engineering innovation – that is, translation of an idea or concept into a valid application and product – then addresses those rarely taught aspects of development that frequently mean the difference between success or failure in an early stage venture. Topics addressed revolve around opportunity selection and development, leadership of innovative efforts, team development and the daily operational elements necessary to successfully developing and executing a plan. While all students may not become entrepreneurs, most will at some point in their career benefit from a thorough understanding of how to lead and manage teams, and will use the concepts, frameworks and practical tools provided by the course.
