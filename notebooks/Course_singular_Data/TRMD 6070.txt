In this course students will learn the basic principles of identifying parasitic helminthes and protozoa in blood, feces, and tissue specimens.  Prepared specimens of the major helminth and protozoan pathogens of humans will be provided for macroscopic and microscopic examination.  Students will learn the basic operations of the microscope and how to identify and distinguish the various helminthes and protozoa.  Samples demonstrating the pathological features of the disease will also be provided.  The techniques for preparing diagnostic specimens of parasites in blood and feces will be reviewed.
