ANTH 4060Anthropology Proseminar(3)It is a four-field seminar course, covering archaeology, linguistics, physical anthropology and socio-cultural anthropology. Topics vary with the current research interests of the faculty presenting the course. Students do primary and secondary research, present their findings orally and in writing.
