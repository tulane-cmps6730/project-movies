BSLS 4970Human Resources Capstone(3)Through an assigned case study and/or field experience in an internship or through their own jobs, students will examine the role of the HR professional as an internal consultant, integrating the major principles developed through the Human Resources curriculum with real-world issues and applying the SHRM competencies, to include staffing and selection, performance management, decision-making using HR metrics, change management, communication, ethical practice, global and cultural effectiveness, and leadership and navigation. The capstone project will serve as a summative learning experience in the HURE major.  This online course includes 2-4 synchronous video conferences, the scheduling of which will be confirmed during the first week of classes, with recordings available for students who are unable to attend.
