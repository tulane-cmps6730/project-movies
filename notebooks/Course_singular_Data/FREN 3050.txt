FREN 3050Literature In Exile(3,4)A presentation of recent works by writers born in the French-speaking former colonies of Africa and the Caribbean, but living and writing elsewhere (e.g., Paris, Montreal, Brooklyn). Some of the questions the course will endeavor to answer are: What happens to cultures when they are displaced? How does one conceive of home when in exile, and is it possible to return? Is rootlessness a source of creativity, or a detriment to it? Reading and discussions entirely in English.
