JWST 3120Jewish Leadership(3)Considering leadership from a Jewish perspective means looking at how Jewish values guide our behavior as leaders. n this course, we will examine how leadership intersects with American Jewish Life. Throughout the course, we will interrogate the idea of Jewish leadership by drawing on Jewish and non-Jewish texts. We will also meet (virtually) with various Jewish leaders who run organizations, lead communities, or work in philanthropy to understand how they approach their work through the lens of Jewish leadership. This course also has an optional service learning component.Corequisite(s):JWSTÂ 3890.
