CENG 7120Thermo of Macromolecules(3)Thermodynamics is applied to macromolecules. Fundamentals of the thermodynamics of polymers in solution and in the melt. Topics of polymer self-assembly, polymer-surfactant interactions, and polymer nanocomposites are incorporated in the course. Students will learn methods of characterization of polymer thermodynamics using spectroscopy, microscopy and scattering techniques.
