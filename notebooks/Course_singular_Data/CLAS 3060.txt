CLAS 3060Greek Drama(3)In this class, we will read several ancient plays (in English translation) written in 5th century BCE Athens alongside a series of 20th and 21st century plays from Nazi-occupied France, apartheid-era South Africa, and Nigeria (during the Iraq War) that draw on these ancient plays for inspiration in radically different political and cultural climates.
