NSCI 7120Graduate Neuroscience II(3)This course is concerned with the structure and function of the human nervous system. In addition to lectures, this course provides hands-on examination of neuroanatomical structures.  Most neuroscience research requires a working knowledge of the structural components of the nervous system as the basis of understanding conceptual aspects of nervous system function.  This course is designed to provide a clear and concise account of the anatomy of the human nervous system in sufficient detail to understand the main functions and common disorders which impact the nervous system.  This method will demonstrate how knowledge of neuroanatomy can aid in understanding clinical symptoms and emphasizes those areas of neuroanatomy which are particularly relevant to human neurological disorders.  In addition, this course will focus on some broad aspects of human neuroscience and how they are rooted in the structure of the nervous system. Restrictions: Open only to graduate students in Neuroscience.  Prerequisite(s):NSCI 7110.Prerequisite(s):NSCI 7110,CELL 6310orNSCI 6310.
