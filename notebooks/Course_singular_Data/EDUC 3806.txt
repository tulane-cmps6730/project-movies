EDUC 3806Effective Reading Instruction for Developing Adolescent Readers(3)This course provides a comprehensive overview of the current knowledge on best practices for teaching older students with reading difficulties. The focus of reading instruction for adolescent readers is word study, fluency, vocabulary, and motivation. The course materials will describe in depth these critical skills adolescent readers need to become proficient readers. Students will study research-based practices that help struggling students improve their skills in the areas listed above. They will present a culturally diverse professional development plan for teachers and school personnel to allocate time and resources so that students receive appropriate, engaging interventions that improve their overall reading. For those taking this course at a graduate level, the emphasis will be placed on remediating a small group of students with reading difficulties. Graduate students will administer assessments to identify their students’ reading difficulties, create and implement a research-informed reading remediation plan, utilize progress monitoring to adjust to their students’ needs, and present their completed work.Prerequisite(s):EDUC 3802.
