EBIO 6430Entomology(4)In this course we will study the organismal, ecological, and evolutionary biology of insects, while surveying recent literature. In addition to learning about insects as organisms and as integral parts of our ecosystem, we will study the scientific process. This course will discuss how scientists come to reach understanding about nature in general, using insects as our model. Insect collection required.
