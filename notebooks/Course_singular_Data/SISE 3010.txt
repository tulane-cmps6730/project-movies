SISE 3010Dsgn Thinking Collective Impac(4)This course offers a practical, experience-based introduction to design-thinking (DT) tools and techniques with a focus on social innovation for collective impact. We use a rights-based approach to our experiments in design thinking, grounding our activities and discussions in the UN Sustainable Development Goals and the UN Declaration of Human Rights. Through a series of projects, you will learn to find a need by looking for gaps highlighted by the SDGs and the Declaration of Human Rights, and you will respond to this need in individual and group activities. Throughout the semester, you will be introduced to the principles and mindsets that are associated with design thinking through discussion, studio and field work, and close collaboration with colleagues and members of the New Orleans community.
