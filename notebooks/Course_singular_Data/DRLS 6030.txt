DRLS 6030Leadership and Economic Analytics(3)This course provides an introduction to economic recovery and resilience in relation to natural and technological hazards. It particularly focuses on issues facing small businesses, community and regional planners, and non-profit advocates in preparing for and recovering from disasters. It also analyzes issues of justice in relation to economic shock. The economic recovery of areas affected by natural and technological disasters is critical to the overall recovery of regions. The return of industries plays an integral part in the production of capital and other resources required by local residents to pursue their own personal recovery. Similarly, in cases of evacuation, the return of businesses and services provides signals to evacuees that their communities may be stable enough to return to. This course therefore explores the fundamentals of economic recovery and resilience by considering the typical impacts that disasters have on businesses, the institutional environment for economic preparation and planning, and the contemporary philosophies and practices of economic resilience.
