CLAS 2610Sex and Gender in Antiquity(3)This course explores a wide range of topics related to sexuality and gender in the ancient Mediterranean. Using ancient literary sources, inscriptions, artwork, and modern scholarship, we will try to reconstruct Greek and Roman attitudes about sexuality and gender at different places and different times. In particular, we will focus on the depiction of female leadership in ancient literature, and will consider the following questions: How do the male writers of antiquity describe female leaders? Do they display the same attributes of leadership as their male counterparts, or is there something distinctly feminine about their mode of leadership? Are women depicted in leaders in various spheres of activity (battle, home, politics, etc.)? Is there always a sense of transgression or inferiority associated with female leadership? Do literary depictions match the primary evidence that documents the roles of women in their communities? How can these ancient texts inform the current debates about women in leadership roles?
