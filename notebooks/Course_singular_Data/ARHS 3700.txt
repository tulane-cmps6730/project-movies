ARHS 3700Art and Architecture of Ancient America(3)The course focuses on the sophisticated and urbanized cultures of the Americas: the Olmec, the Maya, the Mexica (or Aztec), Chavin, Moche, Nazca and Inka. Taking a contextual approach, it pays attention to the ways ancient makers constructed meaning by creating constellations of objects, often collations of buildings, sculptures and cashed offerings. It will also look at large scale environmental manipulations, meant to align human occupations with a divine design.
