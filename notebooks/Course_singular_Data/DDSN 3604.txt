DDSN 3604Motion Design Studio II(3)This studio course builds on foundations of motion and uses advanced motion techniques to create animation narratives that synthesize motion graphics with video elements and user interfaces. The vast suite of Adobe After Effects will allow designers to explore complex features to aid storytelling and creative problem solving. Students will create concept-driven motion projects with motion tracking, 3D layers, and cameras with an emphasis on detailed gestures, micro animations, and design patterns as well as best practices for interactive compatibility to incorporate motion design into mobile and web interfaces to aid user experience.Prerequisite(s):DDSNÂ 2000,1400,2602, 3601,3602and3603.
