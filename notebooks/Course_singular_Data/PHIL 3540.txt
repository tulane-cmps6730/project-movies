PHIL 3540Gender and Justice(3-4)Many contemporary moral and political controversies concern sex- and gender-related issues, and there are also difficult conceptual and theoretical questions about the nature of sex and gender. This course introduces students to some of those practical and theoretical questions by examining work in philosophy, both historical and contemporary, that theorizes about sex, gender, and justice. It examines some foundational theoretical questions (e.g., what sex and gender are, what sex- and gender-related injustice is, and what individuals and the state ought to do about it) and some contemporary moral and political questions (e.g., questions about the gendered division of labor, the gender pay gap, abortion, the #MeToo movement, and trans rights). Students will learn to use the tools of philosophical analysis to achieve a better understanding of the difficult issues implicated in these important theoretical and practical questions.
