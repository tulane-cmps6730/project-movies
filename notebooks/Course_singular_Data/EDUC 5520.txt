EDUC 5520Instructional Practices in Special Education(3)This course examines various ways of assessing student knowledge and identifying and implementing evidence-based practices to increase the success of students with disabilities in mathematics, social studies, science, and English language arts, primarily in grades 3-12.  Tulane students learn best practices for understanding and evaluating curricular demands, monitoring student progress in content-area courses, providing tiered supports and accommodations in teaching, using assessment and grading alternatives, and incorporating the principles of explicit and strategic instruction to design methods that will promote and enhance content-area learning.  This course also presents the needs for specialized services to meet specific learning and/or behavioral needs and provides the basic frameworks for conceptualizing best practices, including the principles of Universal Design for Learning and Multi-Tier Systems of Support (MTSS). At the completion of this course, educators will be able to evaluate and design initial instructional accommodations and interventions for meeting the needs of students with high incidence disabilities.Prerequisite(s):EDUCÂ 5500and5510.
