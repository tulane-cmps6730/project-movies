EPID 7810Human Molecular Genetics(3)This course is designed to prepare students for the study of human health in the post-genome era. The goal of the course is to provide students the fundamental skills and knowledge on the molecular aspects of human genetics, the most current technologies, experimental design, interpretation of genetic data and the use of genomic information for the study of human disease.  The information will be integrated into a big picture of how each component relates to human health both individually (precision medicine) and in a population perspective, relating genetic instability to genetic variation and disease risk. Cancer, gene therapy and stem cell research will be used as an example of disease-related questions.Prerequisite(s):(
