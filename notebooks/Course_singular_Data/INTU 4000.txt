INTU 4000Newcomb Research Seminar(1)This course is designed to provide support and resources from the professor for students in the Newcomb Scholars Program to complete their independent research project. In this course, Newcomb Scholars will incorporate what they have researched and written in the previous seminars, finalize their research question, determine the appropriate research methods, and begin to answer that question in a comprehensive and systematic way that would be recognized by the relevant scholarly community as constituting original and important research. Each Scholar is expected to understand the work that has previously been done in her field and find a place for her research in that body of knowledge. Students will use their skills of analysis, criticism, and synthesis to address or respond to any relevant issues in their fields of study. Each student will present their research project at a campus conference in the Spring semester.
