BMEN 6330Advanced Biofluid Mech(3)This course will cover general intermediate/advanced fluid mechanics, and will provide a foundation from which to base one's studies of biofluid mechanics. Issues pertinent to the study of biofluid mechanics will be emphasized. Topics to be studied include kinematic principles, the Navier-Stokes equations, boundary conditions for viscous flows, basic solutions to steady and unsteady Navier-Stokes equations, turbulence, analysis of the vorticity equation, and interfacial phenomena. Whenever possible, problems of a biological nature will be used as examples.
