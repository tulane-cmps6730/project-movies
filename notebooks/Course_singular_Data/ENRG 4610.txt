ENRG 4610Energy Trends: Electric Power Markets(3)This course covers the fundamental concepts necessary to maintain and operate an efficient, wholesale electric power market. Through in-class simulations, students will apply concepts from operations management, economics, risk management and negotiations to manage physical and financial power portfolios. Lecture topics will include deregulation/industry segmentation, security constrained economic dispatch (including unit commitment and scheduling), locational marginal pricing, resource development (including traditional thermal and renewable resources), and contract negotiation. Instructor-led case studies will review historic successes and failures of deregulated energy firms. Successful completion of this course will provide students with a firm understanding of electric power market operations and portfolio management.
