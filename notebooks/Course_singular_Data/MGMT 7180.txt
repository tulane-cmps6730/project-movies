MGMT 7180Innovation Tech Commercial(3)This course is designed to teach students to develop models of innovation and apply innovation theory and practices from across a range of commercial size-scales—from small startup companies to intrapreneurial units within large, established companies. The twin poles of theory and practice are balanced through classroom lectures and experiential training. Weekly lectures furnish students with effective and portable theoretical frameworks for identifying, selecting, and executing opportunities for technological innovations in healthcare, energy, water, and the environment. In the experiential training component, students will apply their classroom learning to develop targeted, formal innovation and entrepreneurship business models. Completion of this course will supply students with intellectual groundwork and practical experience in advancing inventive technological ideas toward commercialization and ultimately public benefit. This course builds on the frameworks and case method teaching utilized inMGMT 7210Management of Technology and Innovation, which is a recommended prerequisite.
