BMEN 6440Microphysiological Systems(3)Microphysiological Systems (MPS) and organ-on-a-chip technology broadly refer to biologically-inspired engineered systems which integrate cells and 3D tissue constructs to model human physiology and disease in vitro. The term “chip” refers to fluidic culture devices that function in concert with other process control elements to emulate, manipulate, and monitor the biochemical activities, dynamic mechanical environments, and physiological responses of engineered human tissues, organs or organ systems. MPS engineering integrates multiple disciplines including design, microfabrication, cell culture technology, cellular physiology, tissue engineering, microelectromechanical systems, and human disease modeling. Course content covering these MPS foundations guides students through current literature reviews, interactive class discussions, and a semester-long MPS design project.
