ENGP 3380Materials for Energy(3)The course begins with a history of our understanding and utilization of different sources of energy and a review of thermodynamics.  In all cases, the most effective materials used are discussed as well as the relevant fundamental equations used and approaches for improving the figure-of-merit.  The 5 different forms of energy are introduced - mechanical, electromagnetic, thermal, chemical, and nuclear - and discussed.  Materials and techniques used for energy applications are discussed including thermoelectrics, fossil fuels, nanoparticles, different approaches for energy storage, fuel cells, nuclear energy (fission and fusion), energy biological systems - from cellular scale and ATP and catabolism/anabolism to biomass conversion, and magnetohydrodynamics.  Techniques for energy conversion, biomimetics, energy and the environment and material issues for energy transformation are discussed.  The sun is also discussed as a source of energy for photosynthesis, photovoltaics, and photothermal power generation.
