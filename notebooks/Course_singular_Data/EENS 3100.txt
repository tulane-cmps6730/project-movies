EENS 3100Planetary Geology(3)This course will introduce students to the geology of other planetary bodies, focusing on fundamental geologic processes like volcanism, tectonism and impact cratering. The course will focus on rocky planet surfaces but will also include discussions of asteroid surfaces and rocky and icy moons. The class will begin with discussions of interior processes and over the course of the semester we will move towards the surface, exploring volcanism, tectonism, sedimentary processes, and atmospheres. Lectures will focus on discussing these topics for a week and then present a case study of these topics. For example, case studies that may be discussed include plate tectonics, oceans, habitability, and climate change. Interspersed among the discussion of geologic processes will be discussions about how geologic landforms are studied on other planets, including the satellites and instruments used to make remote measurements.
