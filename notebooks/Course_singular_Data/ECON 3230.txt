ECON 3230Econometrics(3)A one semester introduction to econometric theory and practice. After a brief review of probability theory and descriptive and inferential statistics, we will lay the theoretical foundation for the most commonly used tool in applied economics: linear regression.  Our study of linear regression will be based on the Gauss-Markov conditions.  The final portion of the course will cover applications and special cases of linear regression.  The course will make extensive use of the statistical software Stata. Prerequisite(s):ECON 1010and (MATH 1110, 1140,1230or3070).Prerequisite(s):ECON 1010and (MATH 1110, 1140,1230or3070).
