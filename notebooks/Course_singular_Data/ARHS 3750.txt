ARHS 3750Global Contemporary Art(3)This Art History course examines contemporary art in a global context. We will begin by considering early contemporary art, from the late 1960s and 1970s, focusing on issues, theories, and artworks emerging in selected geographic zones: Latin America, East Asia, Sub-Saharan Africa, the Caribbean, Western Europe, the United States, and Eastern Europe. Next, we will consider artists working worldwide from the 1980s through the present, examining emergent mediums such as installation and social practice, and themes such as collectives, the body, and activism.
