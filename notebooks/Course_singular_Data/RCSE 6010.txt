RCSE 6010Water Resources Engineering II(3)This course covers the basic principles of flow in open channels, open channel transitions, pumping system (water and wastewater), flow through hydraulic structures, and drainage analysis. It also includes hydraulics of flow in closed conduits, municipal water distribution systems. The laboratory section of this course focuses on flow measurements and non-uniform flow analysis: e.g., flow over a weir, hydraulic jump, losses through a pipe system, and flow visualization techniques.
