ECON 3500Economics & Health Care Reform(3)The objective of this course is for students to examine health care issues and reforms from an economic perspective. The course will first provide students with an overview of the U.S. health care system and then discuss important problems associated with U.S. health care markets including high health care costs or the high number of uninsured. Students will use theories and concepts from economics to understand these problems and assess the impact of health reforms. Much attention will focus on various provisions of the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA). Topics covered will include the expansion of private and public health insurance, the individual mandate, measures to control health care costs and spending, the regulation of the health insurance industry, the politics and ongoing debates surrounding health care reform, and the impact of health care reform on the economy.
