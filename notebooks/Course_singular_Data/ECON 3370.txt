ECON 3370World Economy(3)This course offers a non-technical introduction to the analysis of international economic issues. While we will be primarily interested in developing standard economic approaches to these issues we will also offer a variety of other useful approaches from political science, sociology, and less mainstream parts of economics. Among specific issues to be treated: protectionism, multinational firms, debt crisis, international macroeconomic policy coordination and European integration.
