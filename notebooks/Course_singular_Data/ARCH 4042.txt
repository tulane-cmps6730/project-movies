ARCH 4042Advanced Studio Elective / Research(6)Upon completing ofARCH 3032, Bachelor of Architecture students are encouraged to engage research, and research based design opportunities. Research studios, taught by both fulltime and visiting faculty, offer a range of topics and projects which explore a variety of architectural issues and areas of research. Students choose elective studios that suit their interests, needs and goals, through focused, faculty led research topics. Advanced Studio Electives develop areas of knowledge depth as well as experience within a broader cultural and disciplinary field. Recently, research studios have ranged in focus from urban design and landscape issues to housing, materials, and design-build (through URBANbuild and Small Center). Some research studios include international travel funded by Mintz Global Travel Studio funding. Travel abroad programs (refer to section on International Study) are also available to students at this point in their education.
