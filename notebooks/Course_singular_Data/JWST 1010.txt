JWST 1010Introduction to Jewish Civilization: Foundations(3)Judaism is a 3,500-year-old tradition that has developed over time as Jewish communities all over the world creatively interacted with the different cultural and historical milieus in which they lived. This course explores the origins of this first of the great Abrahamic faiths. Where does Judaism come from? What is the relationship between Judaism and the Hebrew Bible (also called the Tanakh or Old Testament)? Who holds power in Judaism, and where does this authority originate? How does Judaism understand gender and sexuality, both now and in ancient times? What are the essential texts and teachings of Israelite religion and later Judaism? We will take up these and other questions through study of diverse types of religious literature and historical evidence. No previous knowledge of Judaism or religious studies is required.
