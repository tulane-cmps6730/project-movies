EENS 4230Tectonics(3)Tectonics encompasses the processes of large-scale deformation and the formation of structures that define, or are association with, Earth's tectonic plate boundaries.  The course will include the historical development and testing of plate tectonic hypotheses, as well as a detailed overview of plate tectonics as a current unifying theory.  Lecture format, but will include a limited number of discussions of published papers; field trip component is not graded, but participation is expected.
