ANTH 7650Morphology(3)This course provides an introduction to prosodic and non-prosodic morphology with emphasis on data analysis and argumentation. With data from a variety of languages, the first part of the course will examine non-prosodic morphological processes to highlight the typology of word structure across languages. The second part will examine morphological processes conditioned by prosody, and consider the various frameworks for analyzing the data; eventually, the course will work toward a dormal model like that of McCarth and Prince's "Theory of Prosodic Morphology". The main objectives of the course are: (1) to learn to analyze morphological data; (2) to learn to compare alternative analysis for a given set of data and to find evidence to choose between the alternative, and (3) to learn to present linguistic analysis and argumentation in a coherent essay.
