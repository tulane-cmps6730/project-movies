NSCI 7260Graduate Communications(3)In todayâ€™s competitive science market place, effective communication can be THE deciding factor in obtaining postdoctoral fellowships, faculty positions or alternative career options, as well as in getting grants funded and manuscripts published. Deliberate practice of these skills is therefore critical for graduate level science trainees. This course will involve extensive discussion and practice of oral and written communication. By the end of the semester, students will have prepared a draft of a NIH F-31 proposal, similar to that required for qualifying exams and will receive input on the clarity, rigor, format, grammar, and writing style of this document. This course is open to Ph.D. students only, and is recommended to students in their 4th semester of graduate study.
