CMPS 3360Data Visualization(3)An introduction on how graphical representations of data can be used to aid understanding. This course details the theory and practice of designing effective information or scientific visualizations. The techniques learned in this class have wide applications to all fields in engineering and science, where due to increasing sizes and complexity, data now demands effective presentation and analysis. Topics will include iso-surfacing, volume rendering, transfer functions, vector/tensor fields, topological analysis, large data visualization, and
uncertainty in visualizations. Prerequisite(s):CMPS 1600.Prerequisite(s):CMPS 1600.
