RCSE 6800Intro to River Science & Eng(3)Rivers drain the majority of non-ice-covered land surfaces on Earth and are the primary conduit for freshwater, minerals, carbon, and dissolved ions to the global ocean. In the 21st century, rivers large and small are being increasingly managed for flood control, as a source of water (agricultural, industrial, potable), recreation and navigation, all of which can have system-wide environmental consequences. Future basin and global-scale climate changes must also be considered in management decisions. This course is designed to be a graduate and advanced undergraduate, interdisciplinary examination of river science and engineering practices that can serve as a springboard to more advanced coursework on the disciplinary aspects covered. It will also be useful to practitioners who require an interdisciplinary overview of river systems to more effectively perform their professional duties.
