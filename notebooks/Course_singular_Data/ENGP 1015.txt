ENGP 1015Introduction to Engineering Design(3)The objective of this courses is to introduce high school students to the product design process. Through team projects geared toward creating physical solutions for real world problems, students will be challenged to begin thinking critically and applying physical fundamentals to complex systems. Daily lectures will highlight phases of the design process, including problem identification, conceptual design, and early prototyping. Additionally students will gain experience with computer-aided design and be provided an introduction to rapid prototyping. This will be a 2 week course, and will only be open to high school students.
