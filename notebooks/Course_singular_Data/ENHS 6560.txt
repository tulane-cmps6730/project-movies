ENHS 6560Environmental Health Microbiology(3)This course is designed to provide understanding about microbial pathogens of public health concern and the role of the environment, including water, waste, air and food, in the transmission of infectious diseases. We will explore specific pathogens that cause environmentally transmitted diseases, their detection using both conventional and advanced molecular methods, their prevention and control by technological and other measures, and how the health risks posed by these pathogens are assessed. This course focuses on emerging issues of pathogens in the environment at both local and global levels.Prerequisite(s):ENHSÂ 6030or
