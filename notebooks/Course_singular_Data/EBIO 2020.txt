EBIO 2020Theory and Methods in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology(3)EBIO 2020is an introduction to the fundamental theories and methods in ecology and evolutionary biology for EEBI and ENVB majors. Students will acquire the knowledge and skills needed to succeed in their major through direct, active experiences evaluating and communicating scientific evidence. The course topics are designed to reflect current research interests in the department, such as tropical ecology and behavioral evolution, as well as classic case studies in the discipline. Irrespective of topic, the course emphasizes a practical understanding of the scientific process and focuses on developing the skills needed for upper-level courses in EBIO. The course also provides opportunities for students to become familiar with the research interests of department faculty members, enabling them to identify future research opportunities.Prerequisite(s):EBIO 1010and1015.
