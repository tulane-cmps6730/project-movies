ECON 4300Regulation(3)Provides students with an overview of government regulation and the regulatory process, particularly those regulations focusing on health, safety and the environment. We will use theories and evidence from economics, law and policy to help students answer five questions relating to regulation: Why regulate? How are regulatory rules made? How are regulations enforced? How do we determine whether regulations are successful? What alternatives exist to regulation? Students will have an opportunity to apply what they have learned to a regulatory area of their own choosing.ECON 6300is the master's-level equivalent.
