MATH 1150Long Calculus I(3)The material of Calculus 1210 is covered in two semesters, with diversions for topics in algebra, trigonometry, complex numbers as the need for these topics arises. Mathematics 1150 is a prerequisite for 1160. Students finishing the course sequence 1150-1160 may continue with 1220 or any other course having Calculus 1201 as a prerequisite. The combination of 1150 and 1160 may count as one course toward the B.S. degree requirement.
