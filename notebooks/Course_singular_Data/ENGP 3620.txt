ENGP 3620MicroFab and Nanotech(3)Nano/micro-electromechanical devices (N/MEMS) require knowledge of a broad range of disciplines, from the fundamental physics of mechanics andelectromagnetism to practical nano/microfabrication processes and techniques. This course is opened for the introduction of this interdisciplinaryengineering field, using examples and design projects drawn from real-word N/MEMS applications. Lectures will cover nano/micro-fabricationtechnologies, material properties at different scaling, physical principle and behaviors of nano/microstructural behavior, piezoresistive and capacitivesensing, electrostatic actuation, fluid damping, noise, and feedback systems.
