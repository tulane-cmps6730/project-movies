MGMT 4300Social Venturing for a Sustainable Future(3)This course introduces undergraduate students to the topic of social entrepreneurship, broadly defined as developing innovative, sustainable solutions to address persistent social problems. Drawing from a wide range of academic fields (business management, public administration, economics, psychology, political science, sociology, etc.) and through a team-based, experiential learning approach, students will learn many of the concepts and tools associated with social venturing (e.g., the impact business model canvas, theories of change, logic models, social impact measurement techniques) and actively apply them in one of the social problem domains identified by the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UNSDGs), such as Extreme Poverty, Affordable and Clean Energy, Responsible Consumption and Production, etc. Furthermore, by actively developing a potential solution to that social problem, students will explore, discuss, and live the unique challenges and opportunities associated with social venturing.Prerequisite(s):MGMTÂ 3200or 4140.
