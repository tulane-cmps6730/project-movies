EDUC 5210Residency Student Teach PK-3(3)Part one. The yearlong residency (2 semesters) is the culminating experience of the Early Childhood Education program. It occurs only upon completion of all professional coursework associated with the ECE specialization. In a school setting, residents demonstrate the knowledge, skills, and dispositions they have learned throughout the program for which they are seeking certification and/or degree. Residents observe, assess, plan, teach using differentiated instruction, reflect on teaching practices, and analyze the impact on student achievement while adhering to all the State’s guidelines for residency. In addition, residents meet with their mentor teacher and university faculty member throughout the semester, attend a series of seminars, and participate in professional development opportunities offered by the university. A candidate may complete residency as a student teacher or practitioner resident. When a candidate completes residency as a practitioner resident, they must be hired as a full-time teacher in a school and remain under supervision of a mentor teacher and university faculty member. All residency requirements are within the guidelines of Bulletin 746 – Louisiana Standards for State Certification of School Personnel approved by BESE.Prerequisite(s):EDLA 2000,2890,3160,EDUC 3410,3893,3420,3801,4110,4120and4130.
