SRED 6510Climate Change Resilience & Adaptation(3)This course explores the basic tenets of climate change science as a foundation for further studies in the theories and models of resilience and adaptation in the social, natural and applied sciences. Through a critical reading and analysis of central bodies of literature, students are provided a conceptual and empirical basis for
exploring applied practices and policies advanced in the name of climate change adaptation. The practice component of the course focuses on community resilience in urban planning and policy; engineering resilience in architectural design, civil and systems engineering; ecological resilience in restoration ecology; multi-hazard
risk assessment in disaster risk management; and adaptation mainstreaming in the public and private sectors.
Positioned within an emerging field of study, concepts and methods are explored through a variety of interdisciplinary practices from coastal planning to asset management. With a focus on environmental change and the built environment, students will develop a critical understanding of relevant public policies and
institutions, design and engineering techniques, economic strategies, and planning models. While there are no prerequisites for this course, some interest and general familiarity with environmental studies is useful. This course is intended to serve as an advanced elective for undergraduates and an introductory elective for graduate
students in real estate, architecture, public policy, political economy, environmental studies, and urban studies.
