BEMH 6018Feminist Theory and Practice in Medicine(3)This course introduces students to the history of feminist activity and the development of the discrete discipline known as feminism today. Students will hear a panoply of feminist voices. The course will trace carefully the intersection of queerness, race, and gender, with special attention paid to the ways in which identities unfold uniquely with respect to intersectionality. Students will be able to analyze and apply feminist theory to their own clinical experiences to deepen their understanding of their own practice of medicine.
