PMBA 7180Energy & Env Economics(2)In the past 50 years, the largest industries involved in the energy sector (oil, gas, and electric) have undergone profound changes and have had a large impact on the economy. Managers in the oil, natural gas, and electric industries have had to devise strategies to cope with changes in the marketplace and ever-changing governmental regulations. The energy industries feature a complex mix of regulation and market-driven incentives. Students in this class will learn to use fundamental tools of economics and finance to study the business and public policy issues involved in these energy markets from the exploration, production, distribution, and ultimate sale to consumers. Students will study a number of cases from each of these industries, critically analyzing positions and evidence and formulating recommendations by applying the economic concepts they have learned in the class.
