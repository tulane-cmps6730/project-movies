GESS 4700Sexuality in US History(3)In this course we will examine the ways in which sex, gender and sexuality have been fundamentally reorganized since the 18th century. Focusing primarily on the formation and development of the United States, this seminar aims to deepen your understanding of the distinctive constructions of sexuality in various historical, political, and cultural contexts, how those constructions have transformed over time, and what factors account for those changes. All of our critical inquiries will attend to the ways in which race, class, gender, religion, market cultures, and governments intersect with the history of sexuality.
