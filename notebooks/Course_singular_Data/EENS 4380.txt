EENS 4380Remote Sensing for Env Anlys(3)Continued advancements in remote sensing technologies have resulted in an extraordinary increase in the availability of remotely sensed data of Earth.  Remote sensing data are now used in geology, hydrology, meteorology, environmental sciences, geography, urban planning, anthropology, civil engineering, and environmental monitoring.  This course is built on the techniques learned in the introduction to Remote Sensing course (EENS 4180/6180) by exposing the student to more image processing and analysis for different environmental applications.  Students will use the multispectral, hyperspectral, thermal, Radar, and LiDAR data for watersheds, wetlands, water quality, coastal changes, vegetation analysis, mineral resources, land use and land cover changes.  Students will develop technical skills of digial image processing, analysis, and interpretation using the ENVI software.
