PRES 6540Preservation Advocacy(3)This course will examine preservation advocacy using readings, lectures, and field trips as the primary teaching tools. It is meant to be a complement to the Intro to Preservation course, where students learn about the inner workings and practice of historic preservation – this course allows them to see it in action – and as preparation for Spring’s Internship course. Students will learn about methods for the application of historic preservation practice within the United States and its effects from the individuals and organizations pursuing those methods.
