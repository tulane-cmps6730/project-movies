ARHS 6220Women and Gender in Medieval Art(3,4)This seminar will focus on the relationships between gender and the production and reception of medieval European art and architecture.  Topics to be explored include images of women, works of art commissioned by women, images made for women, architectural spaces designed for women and/or men specifically (i.e. monastic architecture), women as artists, etc.  Comparative material known to have been made for/by men specifically will also be explored as we consider the meaning of the concept of gender.  Feminist theory and various contemporary critical approaches to gender and medieval art will enhance our exploration of specific works.
