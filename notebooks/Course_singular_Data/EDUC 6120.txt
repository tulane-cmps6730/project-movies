EDUC 6120Leading Learning(3)This course examines leading learning of students and adults. Focus areas include the nexus of Dewey’s “child and the curriculum”; the centrality of the instructional task as predictive of student learning; the challenges of improving instruction for each learner; developing, enacting, and scaling vision for learning and then managing for it; and the role of evidence in making decisions about instructional practice. The course also addresses the role of the leader’s identity and previous learning experiences in leading the learning of others, and the implications for guarding against bias. Throughout the course, students examine current systems of learning through classroom observations, interviews with leaders in the field, and case studies.Prerequisite(s):EDUC 6100orMPAD 7120.
