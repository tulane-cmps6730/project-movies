CMPS 2300Intro to Comp Sys & Networking(3)Modern computer systems must take advantage not only of the latest hardware technology, but also of the ability to compute and communicate over a network. In this course the students will study  the principles behind the design of modern operating systems and distributed systems through theoretical study of classic solutions and hands-on programming assignments in C.  The study of architecture and organization of modern operating systems   focuses on the concepts of virtualization, concurrency, and persistence. In the study of distributed systems we will examine topics such as protocol design, asynchronous and synchronous communication, and layered network architecture.
