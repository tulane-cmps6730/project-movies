ANTH 7735Bioarcheology of Human Sacrifice(3)This course will examine the literary, archaeological, and skeletal evidence of human sacrifice in past societies. It will critically review written accounts and physical evidence of the offering of human lives in ritual contexts, with a focus on archaeological sites that show convincing evidence of such activities. Case studies will be used to explore the question of why human lives were offered in particular places and times, while critically evaluating the evidence used to document and interpret such practices.
