MGMT 6250Business Model Development(2)This course is designed to expose students to the concepts integral to entrepreneurship, and the identification of entrepreneurial opportunities. Students will develop their knowledge about the role of entrepreneurship in both dynamic market economies and areas of social impact (i.e., social entrepreneurship), and the particular challenges that come with new venture creation in these different contexts. This course provides students with the opportunity to practice the basic tools of business discovery and validation, both as an instrument for new venture formation and as a core capability for addressing pressing social issues.  It also reviews the key conceptual and theoretical antecedents that underpin opportunity recognition.  By the conclusion of this class, students should have a clear idea of how to take an entrepreneurial idea and engage in a series of iterative tests to determine its potential and viability in the market through the formation of a tractable business model.
