CMPS 1600Intro to Computer Science II(4)This is the second course in the introductory course sequence for Coordinate Major in Computer Science and is the continuation ofCMPS 1500. WhileCMPS 1500focuses on a broad array of topics in computer science and a single language (Python), this class focuses on several core topics in the design, analysis and implementation of computational tools that are drawn from the fields of data structures, software engineering, and programming languages (such as Java, C, Haskell): object-oriented programming, test-driven development; data structures and abstract data types; imperative programming and memory management; functional programming. By solving practical, real-life problems in different programming languages and in different ways, students learn to select a language and approach most appropriate for the situation, and prepare to learn new languages independently. The high-level goal of this course is to train students to be able to draw from a versatile set of skills, which in turn will provide a strong foundation for further study in computer science.
