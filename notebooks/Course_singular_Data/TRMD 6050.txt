TRMD 6050Medical Helminthology(3)Medical Helminthology is the study of worm (helminth) parasites of medical significance to humans.  In this course, we will discuss the helminths which cause human disease in terms of geographic distribution, transmission, clinical presentation and pathology, diagnosis, treatment, and control strategies. Emphasis will be placed on the helminths which affect large populations of humans and on those which are emerging pathogens.  Clinicians will receive a strong grounding in diagnosis and treatment of diseases due to helminths, and public health professionals will appreciate how to apply and evaluate different methods of prevention and control on a population basis. In the laboratory students will integrate what they learn in lecture with identification of the parasite. They will research intriguing clinical vignettes and use the laboratory to discover the answer. Students will learn the basic principles of identifying parasitic helminths in blood, feces, and tissue specimens.
