CLAS 3320Death and Dying from Greece to Rome(3)Death is a universal human experience. Cutting across time, culture, gender, age, and any other division humans might create between ourselves, it affects everyone on earth. Studying death, however, does not have to be morbid; indeed, the evidence for individual and cultural reactions to death has been created entirely by the living. In examining death, therefore, we find an excellent path of inquiry into life. In this course, we will analyze Greek and Roman experiences of death in order to better understand ancient lives. Topics will range widely, with time given to both the literary and material evidence, learning how the two come together to illuminate ancient life. Furthermore, we will consider our contemporary notions of death, particularly its unique role in the culture of New Orleans.
