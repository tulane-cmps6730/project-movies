ARCH 1110Intro to Architecture(3)As a broad introduction to architecture, this course stresses the diversity of architectural discourse historically and presents the principle works and issues of the architectural profession today. The course serves as both a required foundation for architecture majors/minors and as a general introduction to architectural thought for non-majors. Architecture is a notoriously vast subject with many areas of consensus and a few areas of serious contention. This course will present a generalized framework of architectural thought and help to understand works of architecture and design in the larger cultures they serve.
