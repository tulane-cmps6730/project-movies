HMLS 3500Intellignce Rsrch &Anlys(3)This course is designed to give students an understanding of the history and fundamental concepts of intelligence-gathering and analysis.  In addition to tracing the development of intelligence organizations, it examines both the disciplines of intelligence (signals intelligence and espionage, for example) and its products. It focuses on the effects intelligence exercises on decision making, particularly, but not exclusively, in the realm of national security and military policy. It uses case studies to illustrate enduring issues or problems in the study of intelligence.
