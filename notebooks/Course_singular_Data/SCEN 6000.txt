SCEN 6000Entrepreneurship Eng & Biosci(3)This course focuses on taking graduate and senior  capstone  engineering and bioscience research projects to a commercial stage. Not only does one need to take the research projects to an advanced engineering/bioscience stage in order to be commercialized, one needs to develop a competitive business plan, an intellectual property position, and a sustainable competitive advantage. Additionally, this course explores the major economic and technological developments that are shaping the world, how to develop and sustain a competitive bioengineering or biotech start-up firm, how to write a competitive business plan and the proper interaction with venture capitalists, lawyers and investment bankers through the entire business cycle. All through this process, the importance of ethics is continually studied, stressed and examined. Guest speakers are incorporated throughout the semester including a venture capitalist, a business ethicist, startup attorney, investment banker and several bioscience and biomedical engineering entrepreneurs.
