EDUC 6840Teaching Social Studies in ECE(3)This course will focus on the pedagogy and methods of teaching social studies in the PreK-3rd grade classroom. This course covers methods for teaching developmentally appropriate social studies (civics, history, geography, and economics) and the ten NCSS themes. Emphasis will be placed on developmentally appropriate instruction and active learning strategies, including the use of technology, centers, and assessment. Students will work with manipulatives and technology to explore social studies, participate in a
community of learners, solve problems, and learn ways to teach this content to children. For those taking this course at a graduate level, students will learn how to teach social studies as part of an inquiry-based learning experience and demonstrate this type of learning by constructing a social studies unit.Prerequisite(s):EDUCÂ 6830.
