ANTH 7450Methods of Observation in Behavioral Research(3)This course focuses on the development, design, analysis, and presentation of research on behavior using observational methods. While these methods can be used on captive populations (zoo, research center) they are also appropriate for studies of free-ranging animals, including human beings. The student will be exposed to the specific challenges of observational research, and learn appropriate levels of analysis.
