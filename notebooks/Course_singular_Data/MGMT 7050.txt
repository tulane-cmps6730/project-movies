MGMT 7050Managing for Success(3)Managing for Success is an intensive, experiential-oriented course that is aimed at developing fundamental leadership and management skills.  No matter their general mental ability, experience, or drive, managers at any level need core skills to be effective.  These skills are:
•	Self-awareness: Understanding your behavior’s impact on organizational outcomes
•	Communication: Effectively communicating goals and inspiring trust
•	Influence: Being comfortable at persuading, promoting, and delegating
•	Learning agility: Knowing when to change course, and helping others to do so
•	Feedback: Effectively delivering feedback and conducting performance feedback sessions
Along with the development of fundamental skills for managing others, leaders need to know how to establish an organizational climate for success. In this course, students will learn about how to create the environment for success as well as immerse themselves in development, adapt these skills to their own leadership/management contexts, participate with peers in learning, and share ideas on how to apply their lessons learned to the workplace.
