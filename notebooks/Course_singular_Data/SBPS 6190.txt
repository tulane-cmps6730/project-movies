SBPS 6190Racism and Health(3)Enduring racial inequities in health in the U.S. represent a critical public health dilemma. Inequitable patterns in the population-level distribution of disease along the “color line” can be traced to racism – both historical and contemporary forms, spanning multiple ecological levels and domains – which generates systematic differences in disease vulnerability. This graduate course is for students who want to critically evaluate research on race, racism, and health in the U.S. context. Sessions follow a group discussion format to facilitate exchange of ideas. The goal is to foster understandings of the social determinants of racial inequities in health, rather than individual-level risk factors for disease. Also discussed are concepts of white supremacy and privilege, white fragility, and anti-racist public health interventions.
