ENRG 7500Energy Risk Management(3)The course balances both the qualitative and the quantitative aspects of the risk in energy markets. The course begins with a broad qualitative look at risk scenarios. For a qualitative perspective, the course draws heavily from Foundations of Energy Risk Management (FERM) and from Managing Energy Risk (MER). For the quantitative aspects such as forwards, MR Models and options, the course relies primarily on Energy and Power Risk Management (EPRM) and Energy Risk (ERVM). Topics covered include the economic impacts of pricing and investment decisions in these industries, privatization of publicly-owned energy assets, regulation of monopolies and antitrust, the transportation and storage of energy commodities, and the economics of renewable energy sources. Major policy trends related to energy production and use, such as deregulation, climate change, and environmental impacts, are critically analyzed. The course focuses on risk management applications from the perspective of an energy company.Prerequisite(s):ENRG 7110orFINE 6020.
