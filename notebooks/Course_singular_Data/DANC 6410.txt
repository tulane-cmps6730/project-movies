DANC 6410Choreography & Media(3)This course provides an introduction to dance for camera in its various forms, from the video-taping and editing of dance for the purpose of documentation, to the creation of dances made specifically for the screen. It provides a brief overview of aesthetic, historic and cultural representations of the body through image and media, and offers a context in which to explore visual imagery and narrative within the frame of the camera/screen, in contrast to that of the proscenium stage. This material is intended as a springboard for further in-depth exploration.
