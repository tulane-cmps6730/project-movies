PECN 6000Major Seminar In Pol Econ(3,4)The political economy majors' seminar focuses on a large theme or question that no single discipline in the program uniquely claims for its own and no one approach exhausts. Example of such issues: the rise of the nation state, capitalism and democracy, the foundations of economic behavior, the organization and meaning of work, and industrialization, economic growth, and social change. In designing a majors seminar, faculty define the issues that most engage them as teachers and scholars and that sustain a coherent cross-disciplinary course offering.
