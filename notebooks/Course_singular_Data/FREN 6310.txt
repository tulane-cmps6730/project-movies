FREN 6310Renaissance Poetry & Drama(3)Careful analysis of the works of the major poets: Marot, the Ecole Lyonnaise, the Pl√©iade, and D'Aubigny. Special attention is devoted to lyric poetry and to the defense of the French language as a viable literary medium. Special attention is given to poetic violence as experienced in desire, national conquest, and religious strife, so that verse is defined in tension with poetic form. The course privileges Renaissance sonnets, while also including the genres of elegy, dizain, epic, epigrams and political satire.
