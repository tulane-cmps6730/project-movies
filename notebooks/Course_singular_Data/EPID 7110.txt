EPID 7110Spatial Epidemiology(3)This course introduces students to a range of spatial techniques in social epidemiology, including geospatial approaches to exposure and outcome measurement as well as analyses and integration between Geographical Information System (GIS) and traditional software packages. Students will apply problem solving abilities, critical thinking skills, and creative thinking to diverse examples of social and spatial epidemiology. Content will build upon existing GIS courses and will focus on teaching methods and interpretation of spatial analyses for research and programming, including emerging areas such as working with global positioning system (GPS) data or geotagged social media data. Non-content objectives are for students to develop a critical and creative approach to questions in public health which can benefit from spatial epidemiology.Prerequisite(s):(
