EBIO 6480Community Ecology(3)Communities consist of resident populations of all species (e.g., animals, plants, microbes) that coexist in the same place at the same time. The field of community ecology seeks to understand the distribution and abundance of species. Elucidating the processes that give rise to these patterns requires an understanding of how populations of different species interact within communities, and with their abiotic environment. The objectives of this course are to become familiar with the main concepts and theories of community ecology and its applications to pragmatic societal issues.
