EDUC 6850Teaching Science in Early Childhood Classroom(3)This course will prepare prospective teachers to teach science in the early childhood setting (preschool through 3rd grade). This course covers methods for teaching developmentally appropriate topics in science (earth space science, physical science, life science, and engineering/technology. Emphasis will be placed on developmentally appropriate instruction and active learning strategies, including the use of technology in instruction, inquiry-based learning and performance-based assessment. Students will work with manipulatives and technology to explore science, solve problems, and learn ways to teach the three dimensions of science to children. They will also practice creating and refining age-appropriate unit and lesson plans based on the Understanding by Design model (Wiggins & McTighe). For those taking this course at a graduate level, students have opportunities to utilize best practices to inform lesson planning and review research-based pedagogical strategies to teach diverse learners. Students will have the opportunity to research and find curriculum with lessons that teach concepts and skills through case studies, practical tasks, and reflective activities. Students will be able to create a comprehensive list of curricula materials. Then critique an elementary age-appropriate science lesson that examines problems in real-world settings.Prerequisite(s):EDUCÂ 6830.
