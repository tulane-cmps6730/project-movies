ACCN 4550Accounting Internship(1)Freeman School majors may elect to do a Business Internship that will appear as a one-credit, 4000-level course on their transcripts; however, the credit does not apply towards the 122 minimum hours required for a BSM degree. The Internship must be related to one of the majors offered through the BSM program, and the Internship must apply (within an ongoing business organization) the intellectual capital obtained from first- through third-year Freeman School courses. To obtain approval of the Internship, the student must visit the Career Management Center for instructions. The student receives the final grade for the Internship on a Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory basis upon submitting the paper/evaluation to a supervising faculty member in the Career Management Center. This course
is normally offered during the summer and fulfills the “curricular practical training” option for students with F-1 visa status.
