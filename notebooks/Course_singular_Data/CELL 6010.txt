CELL 6010Cellular Biochemistry(3)An examination of the structure and function of biological molecules, energetics of biological reactions, enzyme kinetics, metabolism, synthesis of macromolecules, and assembly of structures. Emphasis is placed on mammalian metabolism and mechanisms of control used to regulate metabolic pathways. Detailed explorations into the chemical function of biomolecules lay the foundation for the course. In addition, a term paper or oral presentation is required.
