EBIO 2050Global Change Biology(3)This course explores the biological basis of environmental issues and the changes occurring at a global scale, divided approximately into halves. The first half will provide a strong foundation in the interactions among biological and physical systems. The second half will be devoted to specific issues including global climate change, atmospheric pollution, community stability, habitat fragmentation, and loss of biodiversity. Changes that have occurred over geological time will be compared with changes in the modern industrial era.
