MATH 7310Applied Mathematics I(3)This is a first year graduate course in Applied Mathematics. A solid working knowledge of linear algebra and advanced calculus is the necessary background for this class. The topics covered include a mix of analytical and numerical methods that are used to understand models described by differential equations. We will emphasize applications from science and engineering, as they are the driving force behind each of the topics addressed.
