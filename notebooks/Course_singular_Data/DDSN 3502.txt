DDSN 3502Digital Art Studio IV(3)This studio course explores advanced digital art techniques with the user in mind for intuition and usability. As developers, we know that immersion is everything. When you’re immersed you lose track of time and become involved in what the game is presenting. A major factor in what makes or breaks immersion is how easy it is for your player to convert an idea into an in-game action -- that is, how fluid your game’s User Experience (UX) is and how well-designed its User Interface (UI) is. A game hurts itself by providing too little information or too much, requiring too many inputs, confusing the player with unhelpful prompts or making it hard for a new player to interact.
