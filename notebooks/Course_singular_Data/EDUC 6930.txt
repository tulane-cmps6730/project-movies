EDUC 6930Methods II Science(3)This is a seminar and practicum course providing opportunities for secondary teacher candidates to acquire skills in teaching methodologies and strategies specific to the science content area in which they are seeking certification. Topics include organization of subject matter, weekly and unit lesson planning using the Understanding by Design model, development of assessments, utilizing information technology for instruction, and working with diverse populations of students. Course activities include teaching in a field site classroom, discussion/reflections, and demonstration of effective use of standards documents, inquiry activities and a review of effective pedagogical literature. A total of 30 clock hours of field experiences are required in the classroom setting. Two professional development experiences are also required. For those taking this course at the graduate level, this course will include a research and analysis component. Students will research their specific science content area and examine the alignment of the Next Generation Science Standards and LA Content Standards. The information gained from these standards will be used to develop a science scope and sequence that provides a crosswalk of the national and state standards, including gaps that may exist in the current LA Science Standards. Students will share this crosswalk with peers and facilitate a discussion about teaching standards through inquiry and problem-solving across all specific sciences.Prerequisite(s):EDUCÂ 6900.
