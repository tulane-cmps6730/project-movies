RCSE 6830River Mechanics & Management(3)This course will provide a thorough understanding of the practical application of river mechanics. This science is a critical, but often overlooked component, of any river management project. The River Mechanics and Management course introduces the student to a wide range of river topics related to the engineering and management of river systems. This includes an advanced examination of fluvial processes, channel stability concepts, sediment transport, and design considerations for commonly used engineering features. The course will also provide instruction on designing structural elements to aid in the management of river channels and floodplain. The course will emphasize the interdisciplinary nature of river science and engineering.Prerequisite(s):RCSEÂ 6800.
