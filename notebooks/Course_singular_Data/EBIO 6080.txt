EBIO 6080Biostatistics and Experimental Design(3)This course will teach students how to interpret statistical data in an evolutionary and ecological context. Special emphasis will be placed on understanding the nature of ecological field experiments, and experimental design. In addition, issues regarding how ecological and evolutionary analyses are perceived in the public media will be discussed. We will cover statistical methods for dealing with such problems (regression, correlation, ANOVA, etc.), and also read papers in ecological and evolutionary journals that highlight statistical issues. The class is designed for students who have not had prior experience with statistics.
