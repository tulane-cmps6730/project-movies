SBPS 7340Population Mobility and Health(2)This course introduces students to the inter-relationships between migration and health. Health and mobility interact in myriad ways for different types of migrants, such as refugees and other types of immigrants in receiving countries, displaced persons in societies undergoing turmoil, itinerant workers, and the homeless. The course provides an overview of how political, economic, and cultural factors at the global and local levels shape migration patterns and health of internal migrants, temporarily displaced persons, immigrants, and refugees. Major themes in the course include 1) current patterns and trends in population mobility; 2) explanatory (theoretical) models linking different types of mobility with associated health outcomes; and 3) major public health challenges to meeting routine and exceptional health needs of mobile populations.
