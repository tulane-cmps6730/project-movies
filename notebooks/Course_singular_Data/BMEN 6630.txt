BMEN 6630Cell Mechanics(3)Fundamental principles of continuum mechanics will be applied to problems of biomechanics at the cellular level. Topics covered include structure of mammalian cells, cell membrane mechanics, mechanics of the cytoskeleton, models of cell viscoelasticity, cell adhesion, active cell processes, flow-induced deformation of blood cells, and experimental techniques (micropipette aspiration, biointerface probe, atomic force microscopy, magnetic twisting cytometry, optical tweezers, and flow chamber assays).
