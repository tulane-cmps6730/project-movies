PORT 4110Race and Ethnicity in Brazilian Literature and Culture(3)This course will focus on the construction of “race” as a social category and ethnicity as a process of cultural distinction in relation to Brazilian nationality. While making use of historical and, to a limit extent, social scientific materials, our focus will be on literary texts and other cultural artifacts dating from the mid-nineteenth century to the present. We will engage canonical texts of Brazilian literature, as well as recent works.
