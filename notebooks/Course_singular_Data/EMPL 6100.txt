EMPL 6100Investigat Employee Complaints(2)This course combines substantive law and practical exercises that students will discuss and work through during classroom sessions. The course will provide an overview of what the law requires when responding to employee complaints, what actions to take (or not take) and the various methods of alternative dispute resolution that may be necessary to resolve the matter. Students will apply knowledge gained from the lecture presentations and readings to analyze hypothetical situations involving employee complaints. These hypothetical scenarios will be built upon each week, giving students the opportunity to guide fictional companies all the way through the investigative process, including EEOC investigations, mediation and arbitration. Heavy emphasis will be placed on studying and understanding the arbitration process in particular.
