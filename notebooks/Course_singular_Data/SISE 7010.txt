SISE 7010Design Thinking for Social Impact(3)This course offers a practical, experience-based introduction to design thinking tools and methods for community-led change and social impact. Through discussion, workshops, and active field work, students will be introduced to the processes, practices, and mindsets that are associated with human-centered design. We use a rights-based approach to our experiments in design thinking, grounding our discussions in the UN Sustainable Development Goals and the UN Declaration of Human Rights. Students will work in close collaboration with Tulane peers and members of the greater New Orleans community to design new products, services, or experiences in response to community needs.
