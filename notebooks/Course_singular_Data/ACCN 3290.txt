ACCN 3290Accounting Analytics(3)This course investigates the use of accounting and related data to provide empirical evidence on business problems. Students focus on the role of the business person rather than the technology person in data analytics. That said, ‘technology’ is still an important part of the course. This course is taught with a hands-on approach and an emphasis on solving problems. So contributing to the class is critical. The objective is to take advantage of accounting data to solve one or more business problems. Through the course students work on all aspects of the data analytics process, including issue identification, data preparation, data analysis, and the communication of results.Prerequisite(s):ACCN 2010.
