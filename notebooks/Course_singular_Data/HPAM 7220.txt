HPAM 7220Positive Organization Design and Development(3)Healthcare delivery organizations are complex and often defy reductionistic models offered by much of management theory. While leadership and management training often focuses on enabling better performance
through structural alignment, process control, and workforce compliance, human behaviors are the fundamental ingredient enabling positive organizational culture and outstanding performance. This course builds upon individual and team-based skills introduced in Relational Communication and Professionalism
(HPAM 6950), and focuses on broader questions of organizational design through the lens of human behavior, narrative, and culture, with an emphasis on creating enabling factors (trust, distributed responsibility, shared mental models, and leverage points for systemic change). Participants will engage with new ways of seeing common systems within their own organizations and will work to redesign them.Prerequisite(s):HPAM 6930,6940,6950and6960.
