BMEN 6970TRIZ - Theory of Inventive Design(3)The objective of this course is to introduce students to TRIZ (Russian acronym for “Theory of Inventive Problem Solving”)—a design method initially developed in the Soviet Union and used today by many Fortune 500 companies. TRIZ is an algorithmic approach to solving technical problems. In this course, students will learn and apply TRIZ principles to the design of technical systems in their area of interest—including but not limited to medical implant design, scientific research, and assistive device technology.BMEN 6970fulfills departmental design “domain” requirement for undergraduates;BMEN 6970additionally requires patent search and application of TRIZ to “design around a patent.”
