INTU 3040Community Engaged Conservation Research Design(3)This 3 credit course builds student capacity to conceptualize, design and articulate community engaged research projects. Along with research design, the course trains students to think and communicate across disciplines via readings, assignments and workshops. Over the course of the semester, students will develop research questions and methodological approaches to produce an ethical, independent research proposal to investigate a problem or question related to rainforest conservation. In addition, students will learn to provide feedback and constructive criticism to the work of their peers and engage with critical perspectives on issues that arise in community engaged conservation. The expectation is that students will go on to implement the research projects that they develop in the context of this course. This course fulfills the Newcomb-Tulane College intensive writing requirement and provides an optional service-learning component.Prerequisite(s):EBIOÂ 3780.
