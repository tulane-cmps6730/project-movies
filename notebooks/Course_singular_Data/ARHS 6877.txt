ARHS 6877Contested Vision Civil War I(3-4)Exploring a wide range of art and visual culture including painting, sculpture, photography, film, performance and popular culture, this course explores contested visions of the Civil War from before the firing of the first shot at Fort Sumter to the present. In addition to the period of the war itself, our study will necessarily look both backward and forward, including consideration of the art and visual culture surrounding slavery and abolition, emancipation, and Reconstruction and reunion, as well as narratives romanticizing the culture of the Old South.
