SLAM 2020Financial Analysis and and Budgets(3)This course offers an accessible introduction for students who may not have a business background to the fundamentals of financial analysis and budgets within business, philanthropic, and arts organizations. Looks at the role of financial budgets in three key areas of an organization’s activities: creating financial assessment information; providing financial decision-making information for strategic organizational planning; and generating market-specific information for the purposes of managing an organization’s
operations, such as product or service development, marketing, and go-to-market strategies. This course will help students better understand the central operations of an organization for which they work and the important roles played by different parts or individuals within an organization. This course can be taken in lieu of ACCN-2010 for the Liberal Arts Management Minor. No pre- or co-requisites.
