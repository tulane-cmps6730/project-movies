HPAM 7100Population Health Analytics(3)There is a wealth of publicly available healthcare, public health, and census data in the United States that can be used for strategic planning, policy research, and advocacy. This intermediate course will teach students to analyze, synthesize, manage, interpret, and communicate these data for decision-making. Students will use publicly available data to evaluate current needs of a patient population and inform decisions on current and future policies and services. The focus will go beyond data from electronic health records and use population level data to analyze social, environmental, and economic issues that impact access to and outcomes of health care. At the complication of this course, students will be expected to produce a high-quality empirical paper that can be submitted for publication or presentation at a conference.
