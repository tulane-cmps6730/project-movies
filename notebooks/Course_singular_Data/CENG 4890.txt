CENG 4890Polymer Engr & Science(3)Fundamentals of polymer science and engineering, including synthesis, characterization, properties and processing of polymeric materials. An overview of polymer structure, including classification, tacticity, conformation and configuration will be given. Synthetic techniques will be reviewed, including addition and condensation polymerization and copolymerization. Polymer thermodynamics will be described, including an introduction to Flory-Huggins theory, as well as polymer-polymer miscibility and blends. A brief overview of characterization will be given, including molecular weight and glass transition temperature determination. Properties will be discussed, including mechanical properties of semi-crystalline polymers and elastomers. The time-temperature superposition principle will be described, as well as a brief introduction to processing techniques. Course may be repeated up to unlimited credit hours.Maximum Hours:99
