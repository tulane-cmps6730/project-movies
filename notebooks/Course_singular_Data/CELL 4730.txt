CELL 4730Neurodevelopment and Disease(3)The assembly of a functional nervous system is one of the most complex developmental processes in nature. This course provides advance knowledge on the mechanisms controlling nervous system development, at the cellular, circuit, and functional levels, and how failure on these mechanisms underlie neurodevelopmental disorders. Also, this course will introduce the student to most current techniques and research topics on neurodevelopment. Prerequisite(s):CELL 3310orNSCI 3310.Prerequisite(s):CELL 3310orNSCI 3310.
