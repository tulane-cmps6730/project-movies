SRED 6540Building Performance(3)This course explores methods used to verify and track building performance in order to reduce operating costs and make financing possible for energy efficiency and other capital improvements. Students will learn the appropriate metrics as well as technologies and methodologies used to measure and analyze energy and water consumption data, verify occupant comfort, and compare buildings against regional and national building databases.
Students will learn how to analyze this data in order to make cost-effective investment decisions and also how benchmarking results can be used to help finance operational changes or building improvements.
Finally, students will be made aware of public policy changes around the country that increasingly incentivize and, in some cases, require energy benchmarking and public reporting. The course will include small group projects to analyze the performance of actual projects in real time, working jointly with students in the M.Arch. and MSRED programs.
