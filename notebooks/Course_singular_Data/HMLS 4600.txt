HMLS 4600Counter-Terrorism(3)This course will examine key policy issues and balances that must be addressed in strategic counterterrorism planning, particularly in the use of applied technology within the context of civil jurisdiction and rule of law.  The course will examine terrorist threats to the homeland and how these threats can be met by the application of science and technology.  Policy issues that address the balance between security and civil liberties that must be resolved to effectively counter terrorism will be discussed.  These issues will be addressed from the governance perspective of a liberal democracy.  Strategic planning principles that integrate capabilities of current and future applied technology and the key legal and policy issues that must be resolved in order to make effective use of information as balanced against civil liberties will be explored as well.
