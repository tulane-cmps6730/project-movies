MGMT 4200Student Venture Accelerator 1(3)In this course, students will develop an understanding of the resources, strategies and management skills required to launch a new business -- and some students will have the opportunity to create viable ventures that they can pursue through Student Venture Accelerator 2 in a subsequent semester. Working out of the Lepage Center’s Student Venture Incubator, students will have the opportunity to take an idea from its earliest inception to analyze potential product-market fit. Throughout this course, student teams will work on their new ventures by developing a business model and business strategy; creating financial, marketing, sales and hiring analyses; developing founding documents and policies; setting up charts of accounts; and developing a new venture pitch.
