EDUC 6160Engaging Family and Community Stakeholders(3)This course provides the foundation for equity-centered educational leadership and the primacy of effective communication.  With the school as the central organizing body, we examine the connections among school personnel, students and families, and community members and groups and the difficulties associated with balancing policy dictates with widespread participation in the educational enterprise.  We investigate channels for identifying, gathering, and using data to inform programming, whether through needs analyses, action research, or participatory processes that serve to disrupt the status quo and empower individuals to thrive.  A series of cases highlight the urgency of making the implicit explicit with respect to the hidden agenda of schooling and unpacking false narratives around difference.
