DATA 2030Data Visualization(3)Students will examine different creative and analytical theories and techniques for understanding and developing data visualizations, including maps, graphs, charts, and interactive tools such as dashboards. Students will access and clean data for visualizing potential, analyze data visualizations for bias and persuasive intent, and create data visualizations to communicate findings and tell engaging stories for diverse audiences. Students will also consider the societal role that data visualizations play in validating knowledge while exploring ethical concerns and critiques around communicating arguments visually. As practice, students will storyboard, create, peer review, and justify design choices when using a variety of open-source data visualizations. Students of all skill levels are welcome, and all data visualization skills will be taught in class.
