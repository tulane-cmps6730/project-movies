PMBA 6200Management Communication(2)focuses on the different ways companies communicate with both internal and external constituencies, including employees, shareholders, regulators, the public, etc. The practical emphasis is on student exercises and includes informal individual briefings, formal group presentations, and media events during crisis situations. The course also uses video and print media extensively to illustrate good and poor communication efforts on the part of existing corporations over the past several years, including examples from the oil and chemical industries, the mining industry, the tobacco industry, the accounting/consulting industry, and the wine/beer industry.
