ARHS 6430Jesuits and the Globe(3,4)This seminar considers the art and architecture commissioned and 
utilized by the Jesuit Order in the late sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, as the Society of Jesus embarked upon a  worldwide project of evangelization. With missions and missionaries from Japan to Germany, Goa to Peru, we will 
consider how this missionary order both adapted to local contexts and attempted to forge a communal identity that stretched across the early modern globe.
