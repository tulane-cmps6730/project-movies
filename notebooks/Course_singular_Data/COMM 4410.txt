COMM 4410Ethnography of Digital Media(3,4)In this course, we consider how ethnographers have adapted to new 21 st century methodological challenges, what new challenges are posed by COVID-19, and how ethnography can shed light on a range of pressing topics in media studies, including the politics of infrastructure, representations of the self, labor and the information economy, media piracy, fan cultures, fake news, and contemporary social movements. As part of the course, students also conduct their own ethnographic research project on a digital media topic of their choosing.
