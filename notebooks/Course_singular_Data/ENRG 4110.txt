ENRG 4110Energy Financial Modeling(3)This course makes the connection between learning textbook finance principles and doing real-world valuations and modeling on public companies. The applications are particularly appropriate in equity research, buy side (hedge fund) financial modeling and investment banking. The course focuses on applications in the energy industry, with an emphasis on financial modeling of renewable energy companies (solar industry), energy transition (electric vehicle) companies, as well as traditional energy companies (oil and gas exploration and production). The course focuses on generating pro-forma financial statements and discounted cash flow valuations using excel based spreadsheets. Class members will generate their own financial models and the professor will guide each student, step-by-step, through the models, showing how they can be best approached in Excel. While the course focuses on the energy industry, its focus on the growth area of the energy transition has should help students to also analyze other growth oriented industries or companies. The traditional energy portion is applicable to other cyclical industries such as mining or metals. Students must have a good grasp of Excel before taking this class.Prerequisite(s):MGSC 3010andFINE 3010*.*May be taken concurrently.
