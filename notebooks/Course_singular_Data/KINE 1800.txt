KINE 1800Wellness in Contemporary Am(3)A holistic approach to wellness is presented via the components of total fitness, e.g., physical, social, emotional, and intellectual.  Emphasis is placed on behaviors that serve to prevent illness and injury rather than rehabilitative strategies that are implemented after the fact.  Content addresses both theoretical and applied perspectives of wellness that should be used in developing personalized exercise programs and healthy lifestyles.  Additional topics to be covered include (but are not limited to): strategies for optimal nutrition, global versus national health and fitness trends, comparative analysis of healthcare systems, alternative forms of preventive/rehabilitative medicine, and environmental impact on wellness.
