MLAR 7020Modern Political Thought(3)This course will be devoted to a study of classical works of modern political philosophy in the Western tradition.  How did the early modern political philosophers try to make a new beginning by turning to a realism they thought missing in the ancients?  How did they go about defending individual rights in society on that basis?  We will examine Machiavelliâ€™s introduction of this approach, and its development in the political theories of thinkers such as Hobbes, Locke and Rousseau.
