MGMT 4620Special Consideration in Nonprofit Organization Management(3)The nonprofit sector employs one in ten working Americans.  Approximately 1.56 million nonprofit organizations (NPOs) contributed nearly $1 trillion to the U.S. economy – 5.4% of GDP – in 2015.  Because NPOs differ from for-profit companies, leading and managing their change-oriented (vs. profit-oriented) mission requires special operational and managerial considerations. This course provides theoretical and practical perspectives to expose students to key issues and challenges shaping the sector.
