BMEN 6650Biomechanics and Biotransport(3)This course provides a review of the mechanics of finitely deformable structures and thermomechanics with applications to the study of biological tissues. The focus of the course will be on the development of mathematical models describing fluid-solid interactions in biological tissues, nutrient transport, damage repair, and discontinuities. In particular, we will cover mixture theory, poroelasticity, microstructural models of cortical and cancellous bone, tendon, ligament, and other tissues, transient and steady-state nutrient transport, and continuum damage theories.Corequisite(s):BMENÂ 6651.
