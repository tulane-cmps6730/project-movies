MGMT 6710Latin America-Global Leadership II(2)This course provides a basis for understanding  Latin American external business environment from a social, cultural, economic, and political perspective, as well as its effect on managerial decisions. General international business theory is covered with lectures, case studies, and readings focused primarily on the countries of Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Mexico, and Venezuela. Effective people management is a key to organizational functioning and success in that region. Therefore, individual competencies required to be an effective manager in Latin America are also identified. Those managerial competencies are studied with four categories: leadership, attitudinal, motivational, and cross-cultural. A direct experience for students is also provided through an international business consulting project and a trip to a major Latin American city.
