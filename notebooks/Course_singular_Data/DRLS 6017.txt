DRLS 6017Gender and Disaster Risk Red(3)This course examines the critical role that women play in strengthening community resilience to multiple disasters, the importance of women's knowledge and experience in the formulation of comprehensive adaptive strategies, and the need for their inclusion in disaster risk reduction and sustainable development planning. The course offers a cross-cultural exploration of the unique needs of women throughout the complete life-cycle of a disaster event and the advantages gained from female participation in disaster preparedness and response. The interdisciplinary study of disasters and their effects on women will investigate gender-bias in disaster practices, the cultural and organizational vulnerability of women, familial disruption and hazard perception, post-disaster domestic and sexual violence against women, and the plight of female refugees.
