PRES 6990Preservation Thesis(6)The Thesis is a major course within the MPS program since it calls upon most of what a student has learned during his or her graduate school experience. There is wide scope with regard to possible topic choices and the location of a thesis subject can be anywhere, although if your thesis is site-specific, you must have some firsthand knowledge of the place by the end of the preceding semester. The thesis topic must relate to the field of historic preservation and its contents should be based mostly on primary research.
