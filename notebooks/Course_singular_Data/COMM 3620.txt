COMM 3620Digital Civic Engagement(1-3)Digital Civic Engagement is a course that studies, analyzes, and teaches how citizens engage communities online to improve public knowledge and civic dialogue. The connectivity created by digital platforms to foster citizen engagement is one of the most important and distinctive organizing features of contemporary political life. Dispersed knowledge and community engagement helps define and deconstruct boundaries of the social and political community while redefining, and at times erasing, divisions that are founded on inequity and exclusion. Given largely asynchronously with synchronous check-ins, students choose how they apply this knowledge by serving a digital nonprofit through one of five service projects: content creation, content curation, media archiving, development/fundraising, online research.
