EENS 6390Geospatial and Numerical Methods(4)Satellites probe Earth's ionosphere, atmosphere, oceans, and subsurface over periods of days to weeks, building large 4D data sets. Earth based data from the internet of things to sophisticated monitoring provide even denser 4D data sets. The broad aims of this course are to learn theory and application of the following broad topics, and to use open source command line software (GMT, Google Earth, QGIS), or commercial (ArcGIS), and Matlab or python programming to solve geospatial data analyses problems.
