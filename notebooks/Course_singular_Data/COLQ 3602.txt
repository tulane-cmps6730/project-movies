COLQ 3602Professional and System Responses to Adverse Childhood Experiences(3)This course is designed to provide the student with both a unique and an integrated perspective of the individual professions (e.g., psychology, pediatrics, social work, education, forensic interviewing, legal, law enforcement, etc.) and professional and system responses related to a child’s exposure to, the prevention of, and the identification and treatment of early adversity, violence, and child maltreatment. Through integrating hands-on experiences, internationally renowned guest speakers, community engagement, writing and social media assignments utilizing a rhetorical appeals approach to effective communication, students are expected to increase their ability to critically evaluate this issue across disciplines while building their skills in effective scientific translation and communication simultaneously to multi-disciplines. This course expands the students’ understanding of the different professional and system responses to adverse childhood experiences (ACEs).
