ARHS 6040Spaces of Art(3)This course will provide a capstone experience for undergraduate majors in art history through an investigation of the various places Western art has been made, exchanged and critically evaluated, from the late medieval period to today.  Each week, students will consider distinct space-for example, the studio, the academy, the auction house-its definition, history and conceptual impacts on the history of Western art.  Students will analyze the material and intellectual culture of each of these spaces, utilizing key case studies drawn from the fifteenth to the twenty-first centuries.
