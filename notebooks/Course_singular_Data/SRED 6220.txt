SRED 6220Sustainable Design & Planning(4)This course provides students with applied skills and experience in synthesizing real estate projects. It builds upon student’s introductory coursework in real estate finance, sustainable urbanism, and architecture and design. As prospective developers, students should begin to have firsthand knowledge of the complexities of development including the development process itself; good design; and synthesizing
constraints into an implementable physical development project. This course is rooted in the creative process as real estate development is inherently a creative problem-solving profession.
As real estate development is a team-based profession requiring the collaboration of multiple disciplines, the approach of this course is based in lectures and site visits leading to innovative team-based student work that results in an implementable development.Prerequisite(s):SRED 6130.
