TRMD 7820Malaria(2)This is an advanced course which provides a rigorous approach to both the basic and applied issues related to malaria and malaria control.  Areas covered in detail include cell biology and biochemistry of the parasite-red cell integration, antimalarial drug action and resistance mechanisms, parasite genetics and cell biology and the immunologic aspects of malaria, including asexual and sexual stage candidate vaccine antigens.  At the conclusion of the semester, students are expected to critically review current malaria control and research strategies and to suggest and defend appropriate alternatives.
