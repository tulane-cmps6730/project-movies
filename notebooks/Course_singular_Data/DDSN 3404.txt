DDSN 3404Copywriting Studio(3)This online studio course advances students' understanding of the discipline of copywriting. Lectures, readings, and case studies explore the many ways language functions in advertising — to educate, sell, influence, entertain, shock, and shape culture. Students will work alone and in pairs to research, concept, and write ads and campaigns for mock clients and service-learning projects. This could include writing for projects in concurrent design courses or refining and extending existing portfolio pieces. Students will also analyze and critique their own and others' writing through written assignments and in-class discussion. Class meets synchronously once each week.
