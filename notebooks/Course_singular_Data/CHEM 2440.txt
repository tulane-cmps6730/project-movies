CHEM 2440Organic Chemistry II: Deep-learning(3)An advanced analysis of the major classes of molecules and reaction types, the spectroscopic analysis of organic molecules, and the major classes of bio(macro)molecules. This small class is focused on group-learning, peer-instruction, and problem solving. Evaluations will be based on non-standard testing, e.g., open-book and/or (effectively) open-ended testing.Prerequisite(s):(CHEM 2410and2415) or (CHEM 2430and2435).Corequisite(s):CHEM 2445.
