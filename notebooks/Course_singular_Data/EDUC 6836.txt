EDUC 6836Elementary Reading Instruction for All Learners(3)Students will learn key reading concepts effective for all 1st-5th grade children including those with language delays, dyslexia, and other reading difficulties. The course will provide students with knowledge about reading screeners and continuous diagnostic assessments that will inform differentiated reading instruction and monitor progress. Students will learn how to deliver structured and differentiated literacy lessons that include the five components of reading according to the National Reading Panel, with an emphasis on fluency, vocabulary, comprehension, and writing. The course will provide students with resources that teach reading using explicit instruction and daily student-teacher interaction to monitor reading progression. For those taking this course at a graduate level, the emphasis will be placed on remediating a small group of students with reading difficulties. Graduate students will administer assessments to identify their students' reading difficulties, create and implement a research-informed reading remediation plan, utilize progress monitoring to adjust to their students' needs, and present their completed work.Prerequisite(s):EDUCÂ 6832.
