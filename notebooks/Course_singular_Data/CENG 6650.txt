CENG 6650Synthetic Biology and Genetic Engineering(3)Introduces the basics of synthetic biology and genetic engineering for biotechnological and health applications. Focuses on synthetic biology and genetic engineering techniques and methods in bacterial and mammalian systems within the context of an engineering-driven approach for reprogramming existing, and constructing new, biological systems via the design-build-test-learn paradigm.Topics include DNA synthesis, DNA recombineering, CRISPR/Cas methods and techniques, modular genetic parts, next generation DNA sequencing, protein engineering, and metabolic engineering.The course will comprise lectures, reading and discussion of primary and secondary literature, and a written project.Prerequisite(s):CENG 4450,4460,CHEM 3830orCELL 3030.
