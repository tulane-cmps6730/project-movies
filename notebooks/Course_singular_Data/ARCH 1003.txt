In addition to class time and field trips, students will spend 15-hours of the curriculum collaborating on the Urban Land lnstitute's (ULI) Urban Plan project, which is a nationally recognized case assignment requiring students to form development teams to respond to a "request for proposals" for the redevelopment of a blighted site in a fictional community. The UrbanPlan project is conducted nationally at the high school, undergraduate, and graduate levels.
