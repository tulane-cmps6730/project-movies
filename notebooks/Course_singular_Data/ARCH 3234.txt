ARCH 3234Tectonics of Anisotropic Material Properties(3)This seminar focuses on the tectonic characteristics of component assembly through the lens of anisotropic material properties. Our goal is to gain insight into how the visual intention and the material execution are reconciled through the design and construction process, informing the tectonics of the assembly as a whole.
