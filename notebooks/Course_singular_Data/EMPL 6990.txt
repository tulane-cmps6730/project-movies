EMPL 6990Capstone Course(3)This course is designed to build upon the doctrinal and practical and strategic knowledge and skills students have acquired during their first five semesters. Students will be assigned to groups of three or four so that they can gain experience in team building, group dynamics, and collegial decision-making. Each team will be required to negotiate a collective bargaining agreement with the course instructor who will provide the basic underlying materials and will represent the interests of the fictional labor union. Once that agreement has been executed, each student will be responsible for drafting each of the four additional projects: (a) a grievance and arbitration policy and procedure: (b) a personnel policy; (c) a sexual harassment policy and enforcement mechanism; (d) a drug testing policy and enforcement mechanism.
