EENS 4180Intro Remote Sensing(3)Remote sensing is a rapidly evolving science and technology with numerous contributions to the Earth, environmental, and ocean sciences, such as monitoring of natural hazards including droughts, floods, landslides, volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, and forest fires. This course introduces the students to the principles of remote sensing with its wide applications in the Earth and environmental sciences. Fundamental knowledge is offered on the physics of remote sensing, photogrammetry, remote sensing data acquisition, remote sensing data types (multispectral, hyperspectral, RADAR, and LiDAR), and numerous applications. The course consists of two components: lectures and labs. In the lectures, the above topics will be reviewed and explained. The laboratory part of this course will cover digital image processing and analysis techniques using ENVI software.
