EENS 6050Natural Hazards & Mitigation(3)The broad aim of this course is to introduce students to the processes causing volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, landslides, tsunamis, and tropical storms, and to outline the steps to their mitigation.  These dynamic Earth process are placed within the general context of plate tectonics, as well as the financial, social, and political implications of these catastrophic events.  All of these processes are moderated by climate change and rising sea level, which are also considered in group discussions and scenerios.  In lieu of a final exam, students prepare and present a hazard case study emphasizing geologic, economic, health, or sociological implications.
