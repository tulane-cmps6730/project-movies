MLAR 7010Ancient Political Thought(3)This course will study classical works of ancient political philosophy in the Western tradition, with a concentration on Plato and Aristotle.  We will examine their understanding of political life and the place of the individual in society, exploring the questions they raise that remain of central importance in our world today: What is justice? What is a citizen? Why is the rule of law desirable? What is the relation between freedom and equality in democracy?
