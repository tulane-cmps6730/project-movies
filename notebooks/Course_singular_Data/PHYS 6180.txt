PHYS 6180Introduction to Feedback Control and Control Theory(3)This course introduces tools for controlling systems via a feedback loop, which power the world around us â€“ from consumer products to ecological and economic systems. The presented mathematical principles are illustrated using MATLAB and a variety of examples. No prior experience with MATLAB and programming is required. The topics covered include the control of nonlinear systems via Lyapunov theory, linearization of nonlinear dynamics, controllability and observability, the Kalman filter, transfer functions, stability, and robustness, as well as the proportional-integral-derivative controller.
