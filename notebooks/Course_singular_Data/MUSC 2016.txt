MUSC 2016Music, Sound and Climate Change(3)This course explores the relation between music, sound and climate
change. We do an overview of the field of acoustic ecology and explore key terms such as ambient music, soundscape, keytones and soundwalks, environmental sound art, among others. We look at issues of sound pollution and the sonic
relations between humans and non-humans across different cultures, especially environmental racisms and the relation between climate change, music and the colonial. We explore these issues through specific audiovisual and sonic materials.
