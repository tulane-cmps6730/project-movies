SLAM 7030Data Driven Strategies(4)If creatives consider their art their most important asset, data is their second. Creative professionals can use data to find footing and a sustainable path forward as entrepreneurs. The information gathered can then be used to trim up costs, boost revenues, and reach a larger audience. By making data collection, storage, and analysis accessible, students will learn the cycle of creative making to make money to creative making. This course is combined with an internship for 4 credits.
