BMEN 6340Soft Tissue Mechanics(3)This course provides an introduction to the various approaches used in modeling soft tissues, with particular attention paid to those of the musculoskeletal system (e.g. ligament, tendon, cartilage). Particular emphasis will be placed on the theoretical and experimental consequences of the large deformation behavior of these tissues. An important objective of this class is to enable the student to develop a sense for the physical and mathematical relationships between the many types of models (and the associated experiments) currently being utilized in soft tissue mechanics.Prerequisite(s):BMENÂ 3650or6650.
