INTU 6850Reproductive Rights, Law, and Policy(1)This course will focus on the Louisiana Legislative Session as a means of understanding the legislative process, civic engagement with that process, and policy and legal concerns that proposed legislation can raise – all within the context of understanding the legal framework surrounding abortion access and reproductive rights. The course will include legal and policy analysis of the most significant U.S. Supreme Court cases involving abortion rights, as well as an overview of the statutory and regulatory landscape applicable to abortion in Louisiana. With that backdrop, the course will then take a hands-on approach to the Louisiana Legislative Session, focusing on proposed bills that will impact reproductive justice. Guest speakers will help students to understand the policy implications – both intended and unintended – related to the proposed bills, as well as other legislation proposed or passed during recent legislative sessions.
