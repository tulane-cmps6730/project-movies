CMPS 6210Algs Comp Struct Bio(3)Over the last few decades, as we have been able to determine whole genome sequences, structural biologists have sought to determine and catalog protein structures with an increasing reliance on computational methods. Automated methods to analyze protein structure make it possible to leverage information from previously solved structures, and to interpret experimental data in a principled way. In this course, we will focus on the myriad of algorithms for analyzing numerous aspects of protein structure and protein-protein interactions.
