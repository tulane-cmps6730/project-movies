EMBA 7430Global Strategy(2-3)Designed to integrate and summarize all core EMBA course work, this course is based on a global management simulation in which teams of students compete against each other for business success within the global market arena while utilizing “real-world” decision making, strategy formulation, problem-solving, and competitive challenges. Teams must analyze the economic conditions of the simulated global environment, insure smooth production, and understand their products relative to their customers, use accounting data to evaluate results and make decisions, finance operations, determine research and development targets, market products, manage employees and the team and respond to the global competition.
