FREN 4400Sustainable Development in the Francophone World(3)Sustainable development in the Francophone World, taught in both French and English, focuses on political, economic, and social aspects of development in francophone developing areas, especially in Africa. We also discuss disaster relief issues with a focus on Haiti. Topics of discussion include: historical and political heritage; French and European development practices in terms of trade, investment, and foreign aid; entrepreneurship as a tool of development; and the impact of globalization and migration on the regions in question. We examine development programs in areas such as poverty, food security, education, human rights and gender equity, health, and the environment, and assess the performance and prospects of the United Nations Millennium Development Goals (2000-2015) and Sustainable Development Goals (2016-2030).Prerequisite(s):PSDV 2400and (FREN 3060,3110,3140,3150,3160,3210,3210,3350or3710).
