ARHS 3230Visual Culture in Golden Age Spain(3)This course will study the cultural role of images, largely painting, in Spain during the period 1500-1700. Topics to be explored include: the pictorial use of mythological themes in the projection of imperial power, the importance of portraiture in the legitimization of the Spanish monarchy, the art market and the social status of the artist. While painting will be our main focus, we will examine other visual documents such as maps and read literary works that illuminate the functions of images in the period.
