The major topics include machine learning, deep learning, and AI and their state-of-the-art applications in biomedicine. Students will acquire mathematical formulations and computer algorithms in regression modeling, data clustering and dimensionality reduction, data classifications (including deep learning), and reinforcement learning. Students will also gain detailed knowledge and hands-on experience in proteomics) and develop programming skills in applying open-source software programs in analyzing and interpreting omics data. Prerequisite: A Biochemistry course.GBCH 7500Human Medical Cellular Biochem(5)The objectives and content of the Human Medical Cellular Biochemistry course are designed to provide students with a comprehensive understanding of cellular structure and function, and the manner by which cellular processes are normally integrated and regulated. This course stresses both the normal cellular function, and why disease states occur if normal cellular processes are disrupted.GBCH 7520Metabol Biochem Human Disease(5)GBCH 7540Med Biochem Grand Rnds Externs(3)GBCH 7550Med Biochem Grand Rounds Exter(3)GBCH 7560Academic Writing & Critique(2)GBCH 7570Signal Transduction/Hormone Ac(2)GBCH 7580Methods in Biochemistry(2)GBCH 7590Cases Research Ethics(2)GBCH 9980Master's Research(0)Course may be repeated up to unlimited credit hours.Maximum Hours:99GBCH 9990Dissertation Research(0)Course may be repeated up to unlimited credit hours.Maximum Hours:99
