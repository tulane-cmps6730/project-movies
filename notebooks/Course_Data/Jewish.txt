JWST 1010Introduction to Jewish Civilization: Foundations(3)Judaism is a 3,500-year-old tradition that has developed over time as Jewish communities all over the world creatively interacted with the different cultural and historical milieus in which they lived. This course explores the origins of this first of the great Abrahamic faiths. Where does Judaism come from? What is the relationship between Judaism and the Hebrew Bible (also called the Tanakh or Old Testament)? Who holds power in Judaism, and where does this authority originate? How does Judaism understand gender and sexuality, both now and in ancient times? What are the essential texts and teachings of Israelite religion and later Judaism? We will take up these and other questions through study of diverse types of religious literature and historical evidence. No previous knowledge of Judaism or religious studies is required.JWST 1020Intro to Jewish Civ:Modern Era(3)This course will introduce the students to the variety of religious expression and understanding in the Jewish tradition in the early modern and modern eras.The focus of the course will begin with biblical texts and then use writings from medieval, early modern, and the modern period to explore how the definitions of Jewishness and conceptions of Jewish belonging change over time.

How did this non-religious orientation arise amongst what many people consider to be a religious community? We will explore how certain non-religious features, such as shared culture, language, custom, dress, and education played an integral part in the definition of Jews and Judaism from their inception, and the role played by these features in the constitution of variant secular forms of Judaism and secular Jewish orientations in the modern period.JWST 1290Semester Abroad(1-20)Semester Abroad.
