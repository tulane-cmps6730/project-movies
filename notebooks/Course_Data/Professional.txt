With a concrete understanding of the market evolution, we will then investigate what   variables (both physical and political) influence market prices on a long term, day ahead, and real time basis. We will also study the infamous market failures, and how regulators have responded to eliminate opportunities for indiscretion. The course will conclude with a brief look at several recent regulatory enactments to more closely align the interests of all market participants and stakeholders (and perhaps make the invisible hand seem more human!)
