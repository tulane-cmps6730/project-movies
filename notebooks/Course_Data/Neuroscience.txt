This course is designed to provide a clear and concise account of the anatomy of the human nervous system in sufficient detail to understand the main functions and common disorders which impact the nervous system.  This method will demonstrate how knowledge of neuroanatomy can aid in understanding clinical symptoms and emphasizes those areas of neuroanatomy which are particularly relevant to human neurological disorders.  In addition, this course will focus on some broad aspects of human neuroscience and how they are rooted in the structure of the nervous system. Restrictions: Open only to graduate students in Neuroscience.  Prerequisite(s):NSCI 7110.Prerequisite(s):NSCI 7110,CELL 6310orNSCI 6310.NSCI 7130Research Rotations(3)First-year doctoral students in Neuroscience complete research rotations in three different laboratories lead by faculty members of the Tulane Brain Institute before placement in a permanent laboratory to pursue doctoral training. The research objectives of each rotation are outlined by the supervising faculty member at the beginning of the rotation, typically 6-8 weeks in length.  Three credits are earned for the first research rotation completed during the fall semester in the doctoral program and three additional credits are earned for the two research rotations completed during the spring semester. Course may be repeated 2 times for credit.
Restrictions: Open only to first-year doctoral students in NeuroscienceCourse Limit:2NSCI 7240College Teaching Pedagogy(3)The objective of Teaching Pedagogy is to provide a structured learning experience for doctoral students in Psychology and Neuroscience to facilitate their preparation to teach at the collegiate level and to increase their competitiveness on the job market. The course focuses on strategies and techniques to teach undergraduate and graduate courses in Psychology and Neuroscience.NSCI 7241College Teaching Practicum(1-4)College Teaching Practicum allows doctoral students in Psychology and Neuroscience to design, prepare, and team-teach a section of an undergraduate course in their areas of expertise. Students receive supervision and mentoring based on classroom observations by Dr. Dohanich and other faculty members. Each student enrolled in the course teaches approximately 25% of an undergraduate course. Final grades are based on the effectiveness of teaching as evaluated by Dr. Dohanich using the attached rubric provided the CELT Peer Observation Program. The College Teaching Pedagogy course (PSYC/NSCI 7240) is the mandatory pre-requisite course for College Teaching Practicum.NSCI 7260Graduate Communications(3)In today’s competitive science market place, effective communication can be THE deciding factor in obtaining postdoctoral fellowships, faculty positions or alternative career options, as well as in getting grants funded and manuscripts published. Deliberate practice of these skills is therefore critical for graduate level science trainees. This course will involve extensive discussion and practice of oral and written communication. By the end of the semester, students will have prepared a draft of a NIH F-31 proposal, similar to that required for qualifying exams and will receive input on the clarity, rigor, format, grammar, and writing style of this document. This course is open to Ph.D. students only, and is recommended to students in their 4th semester of graduate study.NSCI 7450Genome Biology(3)Genome-level science is changing the pace of biomedical research and medicine. This course will examine how whole genomes, transcriptomes, and proteomes are studied, and what we are learning about the biology of multiple organisms using these novel techniques. Epigenetics, genomics. and proteomics will be covered in the context of disease and the development of novel therapeutics.
