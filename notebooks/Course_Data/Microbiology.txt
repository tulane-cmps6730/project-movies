This course will guide students through the scientific writing process, with a focus in the field of biomedical science. In doing so, students will be expected to critically analyze scientific literature in the fields of microbiology and immunology. Weekly sessions will focus on the scientific writing process, critical analysis of published literature, slide presentation preparation, and providing constructive feedback as a reviewer.
