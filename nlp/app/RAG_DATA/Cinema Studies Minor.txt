Cinema Studies Minor Overview Requirements The development of cinema over the course of the last centuries has consolidated audiovisual and institutional practices that continue to be the foundation for today’s emergent moving image practices. The cinema studies faculty are committed to the multidisciplinary study of cinema in its global dimensions. Our teaching and research emphasize theoretical and historical approaches to cinema; the formal analysis of films; cinema’s ties to new technologies from the nineteenth through the twenty-first centuries; and cinema’s sociopolitical, economic, and environmental implications. In keeping with a liberal arts approach, cinema studies students will develop critical reading and writing skills and intellectual flexibility. Most centrally, students will acquire an ability to critically understand and analyze audiovisual material, a training that is essential to media literacy and being an active citizen in today’s media-dominated world.
