Physiology, MS Overview Requirements The Physiology Graduate Program at Tulane University School of Medicine in New Orleans, LA has developed a Master’s program specifically designed to provide advanced training and understanding of the functions of the body, and to serve as the foundation for the study of medicine. Successful completion of this one-year program will increase your competitiveness for medical schools or equivalent professional programs. The program includes Advanced Medical Physiology, Neurophysiology, Molecular and Cellular Biology, and Translational Physiology. The program is open for applications all year around. In addition, our program incorporates opportunities for research, interaction with faculty across multiple disciplines, MCAT prep and physician shadowing. We feel our program has been instrumental in helping students become more competitive for admission to medical school or other professional programs. On average, 84% of our graduates from our first three years (2015-2017) have received acceptance letters to medical or equivalent schools. Students that graduated in May 2018 receive responses to their applications in late Summer or early Fall of 2019. As of mid-August 2019, 40% of our 2018 graduates have already been accepted. Congratulations to all our graduates; we wish them great success in their future careers!
