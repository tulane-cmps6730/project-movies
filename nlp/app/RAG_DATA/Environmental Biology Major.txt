Environmental Biology Major Overview Requirements The major in Environmental Biology is a focused course of study intended for students who are interested in conservation biology, environmental preservation, human health, education, and public policy. Our diverse faculty offer engaging, student-centered courses with ample opportunities for hands-on learning in the lab and field in addition to research and study abroad programming in Ecuador, Australia, and Scandinavia, for example. Students are encouraged to join our labs, where they can develop a wide range of skills and expertise in areas including coastal, aquatic, tropical and disease ecology. The major will prepare students who are interested in seeking employment with environmental agencies of federal, state, and municipal governments or non-governmental organizations, and in private industry, including environmental economics and environmental consulting firms. The program also may appeal to individuals planning to enter the field of environmental law. Global Change Biology and Conservation Biology are required electives for the ENVB major. The major in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology is one of two majors offered by the Ecology and Evolutionary Biology Department to undergraduate students. The Department also offers a major in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology. The major in environmental biology provides understanding of biological processes among populations, communities, and ecosystems. Majors must complete eight core courses, four elective courses, and the capstone requirement.

Internship studies, independent studies and seminars will not fulfill the elective. 2 A minimum of 6 credits of mathematics is required for the Bachelor's degree. Any two Mathematics (MATH) courses numbered 1210 and above may be used to satisfy this requirement. However, the combination of MATH 1150 and MATH 1160 (Long Calculus) may count as one course towards this requirement. Courses in statistics and physics are highly recommended but are not required. 3 This capstone requirement may be satisfied by completion of EBIO 5970 Capstone Research Seminars (2 c.h.) or EBIO 5971 Capstone Research Seminars (2,3 c.h.) . 4 CHEM 2480 or CHEM 2420 & CHEM 2425 could also be taken in place of CHEM 2500
