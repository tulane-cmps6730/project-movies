Energy Law, MJ Overview Requirements The Master of Jurisprudence, in Energy Law is a nonresidential, thirty credit hour program to be offered online with synchronous and asynchronous elements. There will be asynchronous delivery of reading and assessment material online, synchronous live lectures that will be archived for subsequent streaming, and online chat options for student-to-student and student-to-instructor interaction. In addition, each student will be required to attend a two day live program of lectures and other activities at Tulane Law School during the summer. The energy industry is highly regulated, and this program is designed to offer training in legal content that is an essential component of the knowledge base of both the regulated and the regulators. Enrolled students will be provided with the opportunity to upgrade and expand their knowledge and skill levels in their chosen profession. It will do this by providing not only live and online asynchronous instruction in the legal regime, but also extensive practical advice on how to deal with many of the issues facing both energy-related industries and the regulatory agencies such as the development and regulation of fossil fuel, electricity, nuclear and renewable energy sources, climate change, and alternative dispute resolution mechanisms.
