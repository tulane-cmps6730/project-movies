Chemistry Major Overview Requirements Students majoring in chemistry must satisfy the general requirements of the B.S. curriculum as well as the required courses in Chemistry.  Elective courses may be selected from the list of Chemistry courses above the 1000-level.  Alternatively, students may petition the Chemistry Department for approval of other (non-Chemistry) courses.  If the course is not from Chemistry, it must be a course where the methods or concepts are relevant to chemistry.  Students intending to pursue graduate work in chemistry or in an allied interdisciplinary graduate program are advised to select advanced chemistry courses, including 4010 and/or 4020. Close consultation with their department advisors will help to assure development of a program that can be recommended for graduate work. The Department of Chemistry is fully accredited by the Committee on Professional Training of the American Chemical Society. As an alternative to a traditional chemistry major, students can consider a major in Biological Chemistry ( https://catalog.tulane.edu/science-engineering/biological-chemistry-program/biological-chemistry-major/) . This program is certified by the American Society of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (ASBMB). Students majoring in chemistry must satisfy the general requirements of the B.S. curriculum.
