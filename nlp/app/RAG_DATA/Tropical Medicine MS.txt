Tropical Medicine, MS Overview Requirements The MS in Tropical Medicine is an academic degree designed to build a strong knowledge of infectious diseases of global public health importance. Coursework provides a solid foundation in parasitology, vector biology and other infectious diseases. Specialty courses in biological, cellular and epidemiological aspects of pathogens and infectious disease comprise the curriculum. Students are required to carry out original research and write a thesis based on the findings of the research project. Graduates of the MS degree in Tropical Medicine are expected to find careers in public health, biomedical sciences, or related fields at academic institutions, governmental and non-governmental organizations, health care organizations, or biotechnology/pharmaceutical companies.  Many individuals enter the program with the intention of subsequently pursuing doctoral or medical degrees. Program Competencies The following competencies are necessary for success in the particular branch of public health to which this degree relates.  They were developed through rigorous analysis of employers, community and global needs, and the quality standards set forth by accrediting bodies. 1.Explain infectious disease including types of organisms, mechanisms or transmission, and natural history. 2.Demonstrate knowledge of the biology and immunology of host -pathogen interactions and their outcomes. 3. Effectively communicate research-based peer-reviewed literature. 4.Analyze how research projects address specific questions as applied to tropical medicine. 5.Identify appropriate statistical analyses and research methodology for performing hypothesis-driven research that address public health problems. 6. Appraise the strengths and weaknesses of biomedical methods used in public health.
