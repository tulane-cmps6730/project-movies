Medicine, MD Overview Requirements The curriculum for the School of Medicine is designed to prepare future physicians with the knowledge, skills, and behaviors required for any specialty field they choose. The pre-clinical curriculum (years 1 and 2) is taught as a series of system-based modules that progress through two phases. In Phase I, the foundational courses of histology, physiology, biochemistry, and genetics, along with foundations in medicine are organized into system-based modules structured to provide normal structure and function, while still maintaining the identity of each course. Phase II begins in the latter portion of Year 1 and provides the foundational knowledge and skills necessary for understanding pathophysiology and disease states, also in system-based modules containing microbiology, immunology, pathology, pharmacology, behavioral and neurosciences, and clinical medicine. Students begin learning clinical skills early in Year 1. Specialty-based clinical training begins in May of Year 2 and continues throughout most of Year 3.  The final phase of the curriculum is designed to help students choose and prepare for their residency choice while enhancing skills in emergency medicine, radiology and cultural competence. The curriculum provides enough flexibility for early and numerous opportunities in community service and service-learning, dedicated time for students interested in dual degrees (MPH, MBA), or mentored research. Pre-clinical MD curriculum in the School of Medicine is available only to those students who have been accepted into Tulane's MD program. Clinical MD electives in the School of Medicine may be available to visiting students from United States medical schools who apply and are accepted for individual electives through AAMC's VSAS/VSLO platform. Tulane School of Medicine does not offer electives to visiting students from international schools of medicine. Current MD students in the School of Medicine should log into eMedley's eCurriculum for additional registration details, and for more details about courses and rotations, such as objectives, syllabi, permission to add, etc. Degree requirements Students complete their pre-clinical curriculum (first and second years) as a cohort and are registered by the School of Medicine Office of Admissions and Student Affairs.  First- and second-year students will receive information through email listservs and dean's hours about how and when to choose their preclinical electives. Third-year students complete their seven required clinical clerkships in a lock-step fashion.  Third-year students will receive information through email listservs and dean's hours about how and when to find information about their third-year clerkships through eMedley's eCurriculum, and how to request a particular clinical clerkship path. Fourth-year students select block dates for their required fourth-year rotations and electives through a lottery system.  Fourth-year students will receive information through email listservs and dean's hours about how to use eMedley's eCurriculum's registration and scheduling resources.
