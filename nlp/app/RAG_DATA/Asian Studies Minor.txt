Asian Studies Minor Overview Requirements Asian Studies draws from a broad range of courses in the liberal arts, including anthropology, art history, communication, English, film, history, philosophy, political science, and sociology. Students selecting a minor in Asian Studies must complete six classes (minimum 18 credit hours) from the approved Asian Studies course options. Students should demonstrate breadth by taking at least one elective course concerning the East Asian region (i.e. China, Korea, or Japan), and at least one elective course outside of that region – for example, a class on Vietnam or Malaysia. Up to two Asian language courses may count towards the minor. Please consult the online schedule of classes for courses approved for credit in Asian Studies in a given semester.
