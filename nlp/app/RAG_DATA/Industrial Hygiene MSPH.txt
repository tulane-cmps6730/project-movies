Industrial Hygiene, MSPH Overview Requirements Industrial hygiene is the profession that anticipates, recognizes, evaluates, and controls workplace conditions to prevent injury or illness in workers. Industrial hygienists use environmental and workplace monitoring and analytical methods to identify exposures and estimate risk and use engineering, work practices, and protective equipment to control potential health hazards. The MSPH in Industrial Hygiene provides the knowledge and skills to identify workplace hazards, comply with government regulations, and manage occupational exposures and risk. This program is offered on-campus and by distance learning. Accreditation The Industrial Health program is accredited through the Applied Science Accreditation Commission of ABET , an accrediting agency for programs in applied science, computing, engineering, and engineering technology. Tulane’s Industrial Hygiene program has been ABET -accredited since 1996.

NIOSH Training and Education Grant The Tulane MSPH program in Industrial Hygiene is supported by a Training and Education grant awarded by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH). Students in the MSPH–IH program are eligible to apply for a NIOSH traineeship which may provide partial tuition support and stipend.  For further details on the NIOSH training program, contact Program Director Dr. Mark Wilson. Program Competencies At the completion of the MSPH degree, the student will be able to: Anticipate and identify hazards in the workplace using basic and applied scientific and engineering principles. Quantify and evaluate the hazard or risks of occupational health stressors utilizing the methods and techniques of analytical chemistry, other measurement sciences, and statistics. Analyze and interpret toxicology and epidemiology data and information on occupational health hazards. Design and evaluate engineering and administrative controls for workplace hazards, with emphasis on general and local exhaust ventilation. Select and specify appropriate types of personal protective equipment for control of occupational exposures. Demonstrate knowledge of the development, management, and evaluation of industrial hygiene programs. Communicate verbally and in writing, the nature, risks, and remediation of workplace and environmental hazards. Interpret and apply environmental and occupational safety and health regulations and standards.
