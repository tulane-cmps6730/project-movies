Earth and Environmental Sciences, MS Overview Requirements The geosciences aim to increase our understanding of the composition and evolution of the Earth, including its fundamental role in creating the natural environment that humans inhabit. As such, this broad field addresses problems that will likely constitute some of the premier challenges for humankind in the 21st century, given the need to feed a rapidly growing world population, the continuously increasing per capita demand for natural resources, and the associated impacts such as climate change and the vast spectrum of more regional environmental impacts.
