Biomedical Informatics, MS Overview Requirements The program is a two-year (four-semester) thesis program leading to a Master of Science in Biomedical Informatics. The major goal of the program curriculum is to train new Biomedical Informatics (BMI) specialists. The program is primarily designed to enrich and improve the academic credentials of graduates. Our distinctive program emphasizes student development in four areas (coursework, experiential learning, presentation skills, and personal growth), and allows students to broaden and strengthen their academic foundation for further intellectual development and medical research. Each graduate will be able to use their preparation to investigate and apply information and communication technologies to advance research, practice, and solve problems in the related Biomedical fields in a comprehensive, competitive, and effective way. The program is designed to include the following high-level competency areas: · Biomedically-related courses: principal of public health informatics, biomedical imaging and process, advanced bioinformatics. · Data science related courses: introduction to data science, data science with cloud computing, advanced data science analytic techniques, and big data related courses. · The program has reciprocal relationships with specific courses in the graduate programs in Biomedical Engineering, and Biochemistry/ Molecular Biology. The program will provide graduates with marketable skills for informatics careers in biology, medicine, public health, IT trainers, project managers, chief nursing officers, chief medical officers, or research scientists focused on the development of prescriptive analytics from big data sources. These uniquely trained master's graduates will be critical to existing efforts to improve health outcomes. Building a stronger presence in biomedical data sciences and informatics in clinical practice, research, and education, is a high priority for the institutions. This program also prepares students to participate in research programs in academia, healthcare, public health, and industry, as well as to apply the knowledge in clinical, government, and industry settings. The core curriculum emphasizes biomedical applications of data science and big data knowledge. Students must complete a minimum of 30 credit hours from the courses listed below (21 core and at least 9 elective credit hours).
