Clinical Anatomy, MS Overview Requirements The MS Clinical Anatomy degree is designed to train the next generation of educators in the health sciences. This is a 2-year non-thesis program of study of cadaveric dissection-based gross anatomy, embryology, cell biology and histology, and neuroscience leading to a MS degree in Anatomy. It is designed specifically for candidates who wish to develop careers in teaching and research in the anatomical sciences. In the first year, students in the program take anatomy and histology courses along with other graduate courses. In the second year, student take courses and practicums that train them in the principles and practice of medical education and curriculum development. Class size is small to maximize the small-group teaching environment. All graduate courses in the program are taught within the School of Medicine by full time Medical School faculty. This is a two-year non-thesis program that leads to the MS Clinical Anatomy degree. It is designed for bachelor degree graduates and physicians who intend to follow a career in teaching the morphological sciences in colleges as well as research and scholarship in health sciences education. With a MS Clinical Anatomy degree, graduates can apply for teaching positions in anatomy, histology, embryology, neuroanatomy, biomedical sciences. Students must take 42 credit hours of course work over 4 semesters and complete the requirements for the degree.
