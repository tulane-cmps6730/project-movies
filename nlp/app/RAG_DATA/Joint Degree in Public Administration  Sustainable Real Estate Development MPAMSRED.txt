MPA Students interested in pursuing this possibility should confer with the MPA Program Director. MPA / MSRED The School of Professional Advancement (SoPA) and the School of School of Architecture (TuSA) offer a 64 credit MPA / MSRED dual degree. Joint MPA / MSRED degree candidates complete a minimum of 30 credit hours from the MPA and 34 credit hours from the MSRED.  Through this joint program, a student would be able to pursue both the MPA and MSRED simultaneously and earn both degrees with a lower overall credit requirement than if enrolled in each program separately. Upon completion of joint degree requirements, students will be awarded two separate degrees: an MPA degree awarded by SoPA and an MSRED degree awarded by the TuSA. The dual degree option eliminates up to 12 credit hours / 5 classes required to complete each degree separately.
