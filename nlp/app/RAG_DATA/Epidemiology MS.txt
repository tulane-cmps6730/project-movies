Epidemiology, MS Overview Requirements The MS in Epidemiology is an academic degree that prepares students for careers in research. It serves students new to public health as well as those currently working in the field who wish to gain the quantitative skills necessary to conduct population based research. The curriculum focuses on understanding theoretical issues and applying disciplinary methods to the study of public health problems. Coursework includes learning experiences in epidemiologic methods, biostatistics, data management, analysis and interpretation of findings in content areas such as chronic or infectious disease, reproductive, molecular, or genetic epidemiology. Students learn the design, conduct, analysis and interpretation of epidemiological studies, and implementation, from developing protocols and instruments, to the selection and recruitment of subjects, data collection and quality control. These skills prepare graduates for engaging roles in research activities that impact public health planning, control and global disparities. Program Competencies Define the concepts and contents of epidemiology. Formulate a research hypothesis. Determine study aim, objectives and appropriate study design to address the hypothesis. Identify risk and/or preventive factors that may contribute to outcomes and incorporate them into a research study. Use computers to collect, manage and analyze data for evaluation of hypotheses. Evaluate the use of questionnaires and measurement instruments in collection of data to maintain internal validity. Use existing databases to provide background or supportive data to address research questions. Analyze data, interpret the findings and prepare a report of study result. Perform ethical research.

Thesis Students must successfully complete a thesis. The thesis is based on a supervised research project demonstrating scholarship in the area of epidemiology. The results will be presented orally and in writing and reviewed by two faculty members. The master’s thesis must be completed within a year of completion of the required courses. It should be an academic investigation suitable for publishing.
