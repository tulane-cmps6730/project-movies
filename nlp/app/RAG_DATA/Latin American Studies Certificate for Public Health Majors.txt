Latin American Studies Certificate for Public Health Majors Overview Requirements The Undergraduate Certificate in Latin American Studies for Public Health Majors is designed to supplement the Public Health major by developing skills and knowledge connected with Latin American/Latinx, and/or the Caribbean (including diasporas). Students strengthen regional expertise within their major field through (1) language study; (2) public health electives on Latin America/Latinx populations and/or cultural context of infectious disease; (3) through an introduction to Latin America (LAST 1010) and (4) interdisciplinary coursework with core Latin America content. This program is for students who wish to internationalize their studies, deepen their awareness of Latin America and the Caribbean, and to hold a certificate that makes them increasingly competitive for work and advanced studies enhanced by regional understanding and intercultural competency. The program certifies that students have: Obtained a basic comprehension of a Latin American language; Taken course work in the field of public health on Latin America, the Latinx population in the US, or on societal and cultural influences more broadly as they affect health and disease behavior beyond strictly biological mechanisms; Completed an introduction to Latin America survey course (LAST 1010); and Advanced their understanding of public health in the region with two Latin American-content electives.
