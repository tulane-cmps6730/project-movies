Music, BA Overview Requirements The Department of Music offers both a BA and a BFA track for music majors. All students seeking music degrees will begin under the BA music track. Students may then apply to the BFA track “by audition.” No audition is required for admission into the BA program. Ordinarily, BFA auditions will take place during the third semester of matriculation at Tulane. The BA in Music is a flexible degree that gives students grounding in all three fields of music study (performance, theory, and musicology) while allowing them to cater to their particular interests. By choosing from a variety of core courses and electives, students can design their own concentrations in performance, composition, musicology, ethnomusicology, jazz, musical theatre, or other areas.
