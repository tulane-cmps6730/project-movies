Students in the MSPH in Environmental Health Sciences conduct a public health analysis. Applied Practice Experience (SPHL 9980) The Applied Practice Experience (APE) (formerly practicum) is a supervised practice experience conducted in an agency or organization external to the university to gain practical experience. The APE allows students to demonstrate attainment of at least five competencies, including at least 3 from the foundational competencies (CEPH Criterion D2). The APE is conducted after completion of the foundational courses. After identifying the APE setting and defining the competencies, students enter the information into Terra Dotta. An APE report is required that summarizes the field experiences. 1 Selected from courses offered within the department, school, or university in consultation with an academic advisor.
