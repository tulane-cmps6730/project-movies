Biomedical Sciences, PhD with Pharmacology Concentration Overview Requirements In the first two semesters, all students take the identical core curriculum, described below. In conjunction with the course work in the first year, students rotate in 8-week blocks through three of the Program’s participating research laboratories of the student’s choice. This allows students to become more familiar with BMS research and faculty. Students should choose a Dissertation Advisor by the end of the second semester. After completion of the core curriculum, students who choose a dissertation advisor in the Department of Pharmacology have the option to specialize in a pharmacology research emphasis by choosing the Pharmacology Track. To earn a Concentration in Pharmacology, students will complete 25 credit hours of pharmacology-focused coursework, for a total of 52 credit hours for degree. Students who choose to earn a Concentration in Pharmacology will complete 27 credit hours of BMS core curriculum in their first year of study. In year 2, students will complete 25 credit hours of pharmacology-focused coursework.

Seminar I A review of the pertinent background literature and an outline of the research problem. A design of the proposed work and how the results may fit in with the hypothesis which serves as the basis for the thesis. This seminar must be given prior to a student's submission of their doctoral prospectus. Seminar II A presentation of the major points included in the thesis after most of the research data has been accumulated and the thesis is almost completed. This seminar should typically be given within a few months before the final defense. Attendance Attendance at all graduate lectures, exams, small group sessions, advances in pharmacology & departmental seminars is mandatory. If for some reason you are unable to attend a required class or session, you must obtain an excused absence from the Director of Graduate Studies (Dr. Clarkson). An official excuse is defined as: 1. personal illness (verification may be required) 2. family emergency such as a serious illness or death in the immediate family 3. sanctioned events such as the annual BMS retreat, BMS Research Day presentation, or attending a scientific meeting. An excuse for any other event must first be pre-approved by the Department Chair or Director of Graduate Studies.

Students who choose to earn a Concentration in Pharmacology will complete 27 credit hours of BMS core curriculum in their first year of study. In year 2, students will complete 25 credit hours of pharmacology-focused coursework.
