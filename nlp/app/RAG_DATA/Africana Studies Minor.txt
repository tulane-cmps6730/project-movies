Africana Studies Minor Overview Requirements Africana Studies offers a broad course of interdisciplinary study relating to Africa, people of African descent, and the many different contexts of the African Diaspora around the world. Drawing on diverse methodologies and academic disciplines, Africana Studies teaches students to think analytically and critically about global Black experiences across space and time. Africana Studies also trains students to make intellectual connections among global, national, and local contexts. Building on the university's strengths in the social sciences, behavioral sciences, and humanities, Africana Studies provides an intellectual center for teaching, research, and community engagement that prepares students to function effectively in a multicultural society and diverse international environments. Students graduating with a Major or Minor in Africana Studies are well prepared with the cultural resources and tools needed to pursue most professional careers. Recent graduates have enrolled in graduate school, launched for-profit and not-for-profit businesses, and conducted relief work in various African countries. Others have pursued professional careers in medicine, social work, and law. Students should note that more than half of the courses which count toward the Africana Studies Minor are based in other Departments, Programs and Schools across the University.  Students may take a wide range of electives in departments such as Art History, Communication, French, Music, Political Science or Psychology for example in order to complete the Africana Studies Minor.
