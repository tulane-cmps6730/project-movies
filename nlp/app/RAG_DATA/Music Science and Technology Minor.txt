Music Science and Technology Minor Overview Requirements Tulane's Music Science and Technology Minor Curriculum allows students to explore intersections between music, engineering, production, and computer programming, with a focus on the creative applications of technology in the creation of music. The program encourages creativity in technical research and in composition for various media and performance. Area objectives include developing innovative approaches to the scientific and artistic study of music composition, performance, and media, undertaking multidisciplinary research relevant to the creation and perception of music, and fostering an interdisciplinary culture between members of the fine arts, engineering, and science communities on campus. Our students undertake projects in music signal processing, sound synthesis and analysis, computer/electro-acoustic music composition, intermedia, music performance systems design, electronic music history, and music perception. Our expanding computer music composition facilities include a dedicated teaching laboratory with eight student computer workstations.  The music department maintains an up-to-date composition studio featuring professional level microphones, monitors, and controllers with 8.1 channel surround sound capabilities.
