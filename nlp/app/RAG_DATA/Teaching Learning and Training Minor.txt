Teaching, Learning, and Training Minor Overview Requirements The Teaching, Learning, and Training minor examines the critical role of the education system in our society and the importance of education in the life of every individual. The program equips students to identify the purpose for learning in each instance, to develop their own teaching skills, and to facilitate the learning of others across a variety of environments. These learning contexts range from informal experiences to more traditional programs, including teaching in the home, community settings, PK12 schools, institutions of higher education, service organizations such as City Year, Teach for America, and Peace Corps, corporate training divisions, and teaching and training in international contexts.
