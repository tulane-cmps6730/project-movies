Medical Genetics and Genomics, MS Overview Requirements The Hayward Genetics Center offers a 1-year, post-baccalaureate Master in Medical Genetics and Genomics. This multidisciplinary program gives graduates an in-depth understanding of the rapidly advancing field of clinical human genetics. It is designed to prepare qualified individuals for careers in the health sciences, and to provide an educational experience that will enhance the opportunity of being admitted into a postgraduate professional school such as medical school or PhD programs. Most of our students are pre-med, and while it varies from year to year, we estimate that over 90% of our graduates who apply to medical school or osteopathy school have been accepted in subsequent years. In addition to medical school, graduates from our program have also gone on to other careers including dental school, PhD programs, genetic counseling masters programs, and working with biomedical technology companies. The curriculum includes courses that cover the same material as the Tulane Medical School’s first year Medical Genetics and Medical Biochemistry courses. We offer clinical shadowing opportunities in the Tulane Genetics clinics To request more information regarding the Masters program please contact: Dr. Karen Weissbecker Director of Graduate Education Hayward Genetics Center Tulane University School of Medicine 1430 Tulane Avenue New Orleans, Louisiana 70112-2699 Telephone: 504 988-6242 Email: kremer@tulane.edu The program begins every year in the fall semester and is a non-thesis degree .
