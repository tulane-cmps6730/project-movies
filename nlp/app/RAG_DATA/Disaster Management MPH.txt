Disaster Management, MPH Overview Requirements The MPH in Disaster Management program prepares professionals to apply scientific principles to prevent, detect, and mitigate environmental public health problems and threats associated with natural and technological disasters- locally to globally. Students gain skills to implement population-based interventions to protect communities, particularly vulnerable populations, from natural, accidental, and intentional disasters. This MPH offering is intended for both pre-professionals and mid-career individuals. Students typically have a background in a life or physical science or engineering. This course is offered by Distance Learning and on campus. Faculty Lead:  Stephen Murphy, PhD Program Competency Upon completion of the MPH degree in Disaster Management, graduates will have the following competencies: Apply scientific principles to prevent, detect, respond to, and mitigate local and global threats to environmental health that are associated with natural and technological disasters. Integrate public health strategies in each core component of disaster management: prevention, preparedness, response, mitigation, and recovery. Implement population-based interventions to protect communities and particularly vulnerable populations from natural, accidental, and intentional disasters that affect personal and community health. Evaluate the capacity of public health systems to effectively respond to natural and intentional disasters. Apply international, federal, and state regulatory policies, guidelines, and authorities to address public health needs during disasters.

Applied Practice Experience (SPHL 9980) The Applied Practice Experience (APE) (formerly practicum) is a supervised practice experience conducted in an agency or organization external to the university to gain practical experience. The APE allows students to demonstrate attainment of at least five competencies, including at least 3 from the foundational competencies (CEPH Criterion D2). The APE is conducted after completion of the foundational courses. After identifying the APE setting and defining the competencies, students enter the information into Terra Dotta. An APE report is required that summarizes the field experiences. Integrated Learning Experience (SPHL 7950) All students must complete an Integrated Learning Experience (ILE) (formerly culminating experience) that demonstrates the synthesis of foundational and concentration competencies. Students in the MPH in Disaster Management conduct a public health analysis.
