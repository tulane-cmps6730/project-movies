Pre-Med Students Those students who are declared pre-med are to make the following adjustments to the BME curriculum: Substitute CHEM 2410 Organic Chemistry I (3 c.h.) & CHEM 2415 Organic Chemistry Lab I (1 c.h.) for BMEN 2600 Intro Organic & Biochem (3 c.h.) Count CHEM 2420 Organic Chemistry II (3 c.h.) & CHEM 2425 Organic Chemistry Lab II (1 c.h.) as one Professional Elective Count CELL 4010 Cellular Biochemistry (3 c.h.) as a second Professional Elective Count EBIO 1010 Diversity of Life (3 c.h.) & EBIO 1015 Diversity of Life Lab (1 c.h.) as the third Professional Elective No additional Professional Electives are required, except the BMEN 6xxx upper level elective. Note that this adjustment will increase the total required credits toward a BME bachelor's degree by 3 credits due to the additional required laboratories If after you have completed CHEM 2410 Organic Chemistry I (3 c.h.) / CHEM 2415 Organic Chemistry Lab I (1 c.h.) ; or if after you have completed CHEM 2410 Organic Chemistry I (3 c.h.) / CHEM 2415 Organic Chemistry Lab I (1 c.h.) and CHEM 2420 Organic Chemistry II (3 c.h.) / CHEM 2425 Organic Chemistry Lab II (1 c.h.) , you decide to not pursue pre-med, you will be required to take either BMEN 2600 Intro Organic & Biochem (3 c.h.) or CELL 4010 Cellular Biochemistry (3 c.h.) as an appropriate substitute. In this case, CHEM 2410 Organic Chemistry I (3 c.h.) / CHEM 2415 Organic Chemistry Lab I (1 c.h.) , and/or CHEM 2420 Organic Chemistry II (3 c.h.) / CHEM 2425 Organic Chemistry Lab II (1 c.h.) will be counted as one and/or two of your required three, non-6xxx level Professional Electives, respectively
