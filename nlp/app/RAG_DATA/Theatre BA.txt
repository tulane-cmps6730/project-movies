Theatre, BA Overview Requirements The Department of Theatre and Dance offers diverse classes for undergraduate students, designed to give students learning opportunities in performance, acting, directing, design, history, voice, and theory and criticism. Our faculty work locally, nationally, and internationally, employing various methodologies and aesthetics. The department offers a Bachelor of Arts with concentrations in Performance: Acting or Directing, Design, or Theatre Generalist. Admission to the BA in Performance is by audition. These are typically scheduled once a semester. Students interested in Design should submit a letter of application to the Head of the Design Program, requesting admission into the track. Students interested in being theatre majors are strongly encouraged to seek departmental advisement to create a curriculum plan, especially if considering either a semester or year abroad. Majors should finish the Theatre core curriculum as early as possible. The core course requirements for the Bachelor of Arts degree with a major in Theatre consist of: THEA 2010, 2110, 3340, 3350, 3311, 3312, 3313, 2810 or 4710, 4720, 4730 or 4750 (24 credits) An early decision to major in theatre is highly encouraged.
