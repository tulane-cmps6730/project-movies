History Major Overview Requirements The history major requires all students to take a minimum of 30 credits or ten courses (excluding one-credit courses). The major aims to assure that all students have taken at least one course in four areas of the world (United States, Europe, Latin America, Middle East, Asia and Africa). It also aims to assure some exposure by all students to history prior to 1800, when there is much less evidence for making historical judgments than in the modern era, as well as requiring at least one course from the modern era. Apart from these distribution requirements, students are free to pursue their interests in one or more areas of history in as much depth as they choose. All history majors are required to take three seminars. The aim of these seminars is to train students how to understand the contingency of historical interpretation to frame historical questions, to learn to use primary sources to find the evidence necessary to develop historical analysis, and to write papers in clear and coherent prose. All history majors must take two of the department's 6000-level Advanced Seminars. At least one of these Advanced Seminars must be taken during a student’s Junior or Senior year. All 6000-level seminars have, as one of their central requirements, a major research paper that incorporates analytical, research and writing skills.  Finally, students must take a third seminar at either the 3000 or the 6000 level. The department suggests, but does not require, that students take a 3000 level seminar before taking an Advanced Seminar. The History major consists of ten courses totaling at least 30 credits, excluding one-credit courses. All majors must take at least three seminars, including two Advanced Seminars at the 6000 level ( students who declared their majors prior to 2021 AND have completed a Methods Seminar need only take one Advanced Seminar ). The third seminar may be at the 3000 or 6000 level. Seminars must be taken at Tulane. At least one Advanced Seminar must be taken during a student’s junior or senior year. Students must take at least one pre-1800 course and at least one post-1800 course. Students must take at least one course in four of the following six areas: Africa (HISB), Asia (HISC), Europe (HISA and HISE), Latin America (HISL), Middle East (HISM), and United States (HISU). No more than three (3) 1000 level courses may count toward the major. Courses that do not have a letter grade cannot count toward the major. A maximum of two courses from other departments can count towards the major. Advanced Seminars Advanced seminars - numbered 6000 to 6999 -  are open to sophomores, juniors and seniors, and also to graduate students. Sophomores may require permission from the course instructor to enroll in a 6000-level seminar.
