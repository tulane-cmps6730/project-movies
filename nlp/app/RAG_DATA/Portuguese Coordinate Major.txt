Portuguese Coordinate Major Overview Requirements The Department of Spanish and Portuguese is dedicated to the study of languages, literatures, and cultures of Latin America and the Iberian Peninsula. Our department offers a wide variety of undergraduate classes, from basic language instruction in Spanish and Portuguese to upper-level courses in literature, culture, and film. Undergraduates may pursue majors and minors in Spanish and Portuguese, or a Joint Major in Spanish and Portuguese. Students majoring in Portuguese must complete ten courses (30 credits) beyond the 2000 level. All majors must take at least three 6000-level courses except for Junior Year Abroad students, who are required to take two 6000-level courses in the department. The Portuguese Major is classified as a coordinate major, meaning that it must be paired with a separate primary major (for example, Latin American Studies, Public Health, etc) and cannot be taken as a student's sole major. Students complete their writing intensive requirement and service learning requirement through the primary major.
