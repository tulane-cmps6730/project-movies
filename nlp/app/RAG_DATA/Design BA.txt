Design, BA Overview Requirements The Bachelor of Arts in Design undergraduate major explores design as mechanism for positive change. Design students learn to integrate multiple aspects of a problem and respond with interdisciplinary solutions to address challenges of an evolving world. Our program centers design as a state of mind for building empathy, humility, and self-awareness — the first steps toward collaborating with other disciplines when solving complex problems. Rather than focusing on one specific aspect of design, our curriculum touches upon all facets within the design discipline (e.g. graphic, fashion, industrial, interior) building relationships between design innovation and engagement with society, culture, and the built environment. Located within the School of Architecture, this program emphasizes design practice across disciplines, including and beyond architecture. Students will learn methods of creative problem-solving, visual communication, and spatial composition through a series of lecture-based and project-based studio courses. The Bachelor of Arts in Design program educates students to apply design thinking across diverse fields in humanities, business, and sciences and invites change-minded students to learn principles of design and methods of creative process to be effective in a range of applications. The major is intended for students interested in an interdisciplinary path through innovative approaches and collaborative projects.
