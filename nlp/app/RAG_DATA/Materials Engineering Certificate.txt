Materials Engineering Certificate Overview Requirements Engineering Physics majors have the opportunity to focus their elective course work in a specific concentration area  and earn a certificate if they are interested in a more focused field of study. Successful completion of an ENGP certificate requires a student to choose any four out of the seven total electives (i.e., out of the four engineering electives, one contemporary physics elective, one classical physics elective, and one broader technical elective) from within a particular concentration area. Engineering Physics Major The allowable electives for the Materials Engineering Certificate are listed in the Requirements.
