History, MA Please note that we do not offer a terminal M.A. degree outside of the 4+1 program and the Tulane Staff M.A. The 4+1 Program in History The 4+1 in History offers current Tulane students and recent grads the opportunity to earn an M.A. degree through our accelerated M.A. program. The program is designed for History majors or those who have taken at least 6 units of 6000 or 7000 level history courses that will then count towards the accelerated M.A. The application and admissions process is fairly straightforward; students do not need to take the GRE, nor is there a language requirement once in the program.  Students, however, must have a minimum GPA of 3.33 in the History courses in order to be eligible to apply, and must maintain this GPA during the program.  In addition, they must have a letter of recommendation from a current Tulane History Department faculty member who will agree to work with the student through completion of the M.A. The M.A. degree is earned with a minimum of 30 hours of coursework. At least 6 hours (2 courses) and up to 12 hours (4 courses) of applicable 6000- or 7000-level History courses taken as an undergraduate may count toward the degree.  Students may choose to complete the 4+1 either with a thesis or non-thesis option.  The non-thesis option requires a comprehensive exam administered by two faculty members. Applications are accepted on a rolling basis, but priority evaluations is given to students who submit all required materials by April 1.  Students must apply to the 4+1 program before receiving their undergraduate degrees from Tulane.
