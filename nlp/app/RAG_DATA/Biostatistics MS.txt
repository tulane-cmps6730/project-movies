Biostatistics, MS Overview Requirements The Master of Science in Biostatistics educates students in the basic methods of mathematical and applied statistics for health data analysis. Through courses in epidemiology and related subjects, students become familiar with the general areas of public health to which statistical methodologies may be applied. Coursework includes mathematical statistics and probability theory, applied and theoretical multivariate methods, stochastic processes, basic epidemiology, and demography, enabling the student to assist in the application of statistical theory to applied statistical problems. Graduates from the MS in Biostatistics program typically pursue careers in academic research or as statisticians on projects. Program Competencies Define and use the principles of probability and mathematical statistics to guide the selection and application of data analysis methods. Apply descriptive and inferential methodology based on study design in solving research questions. Design experimental and observational studies for research projects, addressing specific questions in statistics or in an applied field. Interpret and effectively communicate research results orally and in writing.
