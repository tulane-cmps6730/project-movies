Real Estate Minor Overview Requirements A Minor in Real Estate is offered through the Tulane School of Architecture and is open to all Tulane undergraduate students. The program is designed to provide students with the essential knowledge and skillsets needed for entry-level positions and careers in the real estate industry. The program provides a strong foundation in Real Estate as a business, specifically focused on careers as an investor, owner, developer, financial analyst, project manager, and consultant. To earn a Minor in Real Estate students must complete five (5) courses, including four (4) core courses and one (1) approved elective course. The minor may be completed over a single summer for a flat tuition rate -- one course during the "May Mester", and two courses during each of the the Early Summer and Late Summer terms. Or students can choose to take courses at their own pace, during any of the fall, spring, or summer terms prior to graduation.  Visit the Real Estate Summer Minor webpage for more details including tuition fees, dates, etc. All courses in the minor also count towards the major requirements should a student later decide to instead pursue the BS in Real Estate.
