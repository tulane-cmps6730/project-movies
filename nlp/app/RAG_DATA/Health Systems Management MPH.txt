The Practicum allows students to demonstrate attainment of at least five competencies, including at least 3 from the foundational competencies (CEPH Criterion D2). The Practicum is conducted after completion of the foundational courses. After identifying the Practicum setting and defining the competencies, students enter the information into Terra Dotta. A Practicum report is required that summarizes the field experiences. 3 All students must complete an Integrated Learning Experience (ILE) (formerly culminating experience) that demonstrates the synthesis of foundational and concentration competencies. Students in the MPH in Epidemiology conduct a public health analysis.
