Cell and Molecular Biology Major Overview Requirements The major in Cell and Molecular Biology is focused on the mechanistic study of the life of the cell at the molecular level. The curriculum is interdisciplinary and includes courses in physics, chemistry, and genetics in addition to molecular and cellular biology. Training in these areas is beneficial for careers in biological research, a number of high tech industries, medicine, and allied health professions. This challenging major requires creativity, rigor, and the ability to analyze, distill, and interpret data. A love of living systems and a level of comfort with complexity are both essential. Due to the extensive overlap in curricula, Cell and Molecular Biology majors cannot double major in Biological Chemistry. Students can double major in Cell and Molecular Biology and Neuroscience, but there are additional requirements that must be met beyond those requirements for most double major combinations. Students majoring in cell and molecular biology must complete a minimum of eleven courses in the biology components, totaling at least 25 credits; 16 credits in chemistry; and 8 credits of physics with laboratories. Students must also complete Calculus ( MATH 1210 Calculus I (4 c.h.) or MATH 1310 Consolidated Calculus (4 c.h.) ) and Statistics for Scientists ( MATH 1230 Stats For Scientists (4 c.h.) ) to satisfy the major and BS requirements.

Only one laboratory elective may be satisfied by independent laboratory research ( CELL 4910 Independent Study (1 to 3 c.h.) , CELL 4920 Independent Study (1 to 3 c.h.) , CELL 4990 Honors Thesis (3 c.h.) or CELL 5000 Honors Thesis (4 c.h.) ). Students may use approved courses from other departments to fill the elective component. A list of courses which fulfill this requirement is available on the CMB Department website or from the CMB Department office. Total credit hours: 5-11.
