French Minor Overview Requirements The minor in French is designed to provide students with the necessary skills to communicate effectively in French both orally and in writing. The French program further seeks to familiarize students with the most influential literary, philosophical, critical, and cinematographic works in French, properly understood within their cultural and historical context; to introduce them to the major social and political developments that have shaped the Francophone world, including North Africa, Sub-Saharan Africa, Asia, and the Caribbean; and to provide them with an understanding of the structure of the French language, attitudes towards its use, and the variation it displays across time, geographical space, and social groups. Students may also explore Louisiana Creole and Louisiana French in linguistics classes and fieldwork. The junior year and semester abroad programs are integral to the majors in French and are also encouraged for non-majors. Placement Entering freshmen are placed at the appropriate level by assessment of their high school records and their performance on a placement test. Successful completion of French 2030, a passing score on the French proficiency test, a score of 4 or 5 on the Advanced Placement examination, or a score of 640 or better on the College Board examination fulfills the language requirement for graduation. A total of 6 courses, 19 credits, is required.
