Clinical Research, MS Overview Requirements The Tulane MSCR Program is a structured program leading to a Master of Science in Clinical Research degree from the Tulane University School of Medicine. It usually requires 2 to 3 years to complete the curriculum including the mentored research requirement. Potential trainees will be self-referred or nominated by their Program Director. After approval by the MSCR Internal Advisory Committee, the trainee will enter the MSCR program, which features four components: Formal didactic training providing the tools to conduct modern clinical and translational research; A clinical research and clinical medicine seminar series, providing peer interaction and mentor guidance on research topics; A mentored clinical research project; An annual MSCR retreat Each Clinical Research Scholar will identify a research preceptor from the scholar's home division or department. In addition, each scholar will have a career mentor from the MSCR program. In lieu of a thesis, the MSCR candidate is expected to prepare a grant ("K" or "R" format) and/or a paper based on the mentored research. Clinical Fellows participating in the MSCR Program must also complete their individual clinical training program requirements.
