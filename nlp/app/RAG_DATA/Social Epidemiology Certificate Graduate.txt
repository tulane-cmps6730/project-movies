Social Epidemiology, Certificate (Graduate) Overview Requirements This concentrated training in social and spatial epidemiology is aimed at improving our capacity to monitor, research, and address social determinants of health and health inequities. Courses in this certificate program combine theory from the social sciences with rigorous epidemiological and social science methods utilized to understand and to address the connections between social factors and health. Purpose Our purpose is to train scholars and practitioners in the conduct of rigorous research and evaluation methods aimed at understanding and addressing social determinants of health, to improve population health and reduce health inequalities locally, nationally, and internationally. The certificate is aimed at master’s students who want training in social epidemiologic methods, specifically, preparing them for an ever-increasing workforce aimed at tackling these fundamental causes of health and reducing health disparities. Students will be prepared to work in a variety of settings, both research and practice, and at multiple levels, but also in other non-public health and interdisciplinary settings. Competencies Apply epidemiological methods to social and population health problems. Describe the different study designs and data collection tools utilized in social epidemiology Demonstrate proficiency in data management, collection, and analysis of social epidemiologic and spatial data. Succinctly describe and interpret data from a social epidemiologic inquiry.
