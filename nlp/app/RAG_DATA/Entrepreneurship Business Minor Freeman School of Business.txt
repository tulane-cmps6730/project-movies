Entrepreneurship Business Minor (Freeman School of Business) Overview Requirements Training in entrepreneurship is now viewed as an integral component of a contemporary undergraduate business curriculum and critical for the professional development of undergraduate students within and beyond the walls of business schools. To further develop the entrepreneurial mindset and skillset of undergraduates, Tulane University offers a new eighteen-credit minor in “Entrepreneurial Business” housed in the A.B. Freeman School of Business.  At the undergraduate level, Freeman offers this Entrepreneurial Business minor only for students who are enrolled as business majors. The courses for the minor are designed and intended to be taken in sequential order.  In other words, students would ideally first take the courses in the core requirements section, followed by the three elective courses, followed by the experiential learning component.
