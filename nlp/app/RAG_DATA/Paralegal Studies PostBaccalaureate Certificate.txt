Paralegal Studies Post-Baccalaureate Certificate Overview Requirements The School of Professional Advancement's General Legal Studies Program was first approved by the American Bar Association’s (ABA) Standing Committee on Paralegals in 1981 and earned its most recent reapproval in 2023.  Throughout this time, the program has maintained compliance with the rigorous ABA guidelines that govern all aspects of our operations, providing our graduates with the  superior education that ABA requires and legal employers demand. The Paralegal Studies Post-Baccalaureate Certificate (PBC) is available for students who have completed a bachelor's degree from a regionally accredited institution, earning an overall GPA of at least 2.0. The 9-course, 27-credit curriculum for the Paralegal Studies PBC focuses upon legal office skills, ethics, and substantive law courses.  Most students finish the PBC and embark upon their new careers within one year.  Carefully sequenced coursework includes eight core skills classes that emphasize legal research, writing, ethics, and analysis, along with law office technology and other practical aspects of the legal profession. Upper-level electives allow students to explore important areas of substantive law. In or near the final semester, students not already employed in law offices take the practicum course, which includes a 100-hour internship in a legal services office and an instructional component focusing upon legal ethics, professionalism, and career success skills. GLSP courses are offered in person or online, in either synchronous remote (meeting one evening per week on Zoom) or fully online ( with at least two Zoom sessions that are recorded for those who cannot attend) formats .  Subject to the ABA requirement that each student complete at least 3 classes (9 credits) in person or in synchronous remote format, you may take your GLSP classes from wherever you may be , in the format that suits your needs and preferences . Many of our PBC graduates pursue careers as paralegals or in other positions in law firms, courts, corporations, government agencies, non-profit legal service providers, and other legal offices, while others enter law school and become attorneys. General Legal Studies Program mission statement: The General Legal Studies Program provides our students with the skills, wisdom, and integrity to create, communicate and conserve knowledge and to pursue careers as efficient, ethical legal professionals who are prepared to assist attorneys in courts, governmental agencies, law firms, and other legal services offices, or to apply to law school after graduation, if they choose.

Credit Transfers for the PBC in Paralegal Studies SoPA’s General Legal Studies Program does not accept the transfer of credits for paralegal courses completed at paralegal programs that were not approved by ABA’s Standing Committee on Paralegals at the time the courses were taken. Consistent with Tulane SoPA’s credit transfer policy , students pursing the Post-Baccalaureate Certificate in Paralegal Studies may be permitted to transfer in up to 6 credits (2 classes) of the 27 required legal studies/paralegal course credits, provided each course (1) meets all SoPA course transfer requirements; (2) was completed at a paralegal or legal studies program that was approved by ABA’s Standing Committee on Paralegals at the time the class was completed; and (3) has been reviewed and approved by the General Legal Studies Program Director. Note: Paralegals are trained professionals who work under the supervision of licensed attorneys. Paralegals are not lawyers and are not permitted to practice law or to provide legal services directly to the public, except as permitted by law.
