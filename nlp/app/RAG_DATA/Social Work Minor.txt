Social Work Minor Overview Requirements The social work minor introduces to students to the knowledge, skills, and values that are required in those jobs, particularly students who are majoring in sociology, psychology, and gender and sexuality studies.  The minor also comports with the institutional motto of “not for one’s self, but for one’s own.” In addition, those students interested in any future career opportunities that involves human relationship such as business, public health, medicine, and law will be enhanced by the minor offering a unique perspective to their professional program preparedness.  Moreover, it will provide undergraduates across all majors to see social work as meaningful and vital career opportunity and gateway into our MSW program.  Those students who successfully complete the social work minor and graduate with a 3.0 GPA, will automatically be accepted into the TSSW MSW program and receive priority consideration of merit scholarships. The social work minor requires 18 credit hours (six classes total) of social work content. Within the minor, there are three required courses (three credits each, totaling nine credit hours) and three additional social work electives (an additional nine hours).
