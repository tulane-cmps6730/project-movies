Geographic Information Systems Certificate Overview Requirements The Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences at Tulane University offers a certificate program in Geographic Information Systems (GIS). GIS interfaces, like ESRI ArcGIS, are focused on integration, management and interpretation of remote and ground-based datasets and are important tools for a variety of fields, including physical and environmental sciences, life science, urban planning and management, political science, civil engineering, anthropology, economy/business, education administration, real estate, public health and health care. The primary goal of this certificate program is to ensure that students become grounded in GIS concepts and theory including organization, management, and visualization of geospatial data, as well as in the acquisition and interpretation of remote datasets. A minimum of 13 credits distributed over two required courses and two electives is necessary to complete the GIS certificate. This coursework is typically completed over two years.
