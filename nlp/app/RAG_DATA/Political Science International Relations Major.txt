Political Science/ International Relations Major Overview Requirements Students majoring in political science are challenged to think creatively and analytically about historically and currently relevant topics. Through participation in lectures, seminars, internships, and independent studies, our students develop critical reasoning, communication, data analysis, and reflectional skills. Many graduates go on to obtain advanced degrees in law, business, public policy, political science, and public administration. Others apply their degree to relevant career employment, pursuing work in political campaigns, lobbies, non-profit foundations, think tanks, corporations, public relations firms, news organizations, government, and international organizations.
