Biostatistics, MSPH Overview Requirements The MSPH program in Biostatistics emphasizes applied data analysis in the areas of public health and medicine, by preparing students to analyze data in a wide range of settings, including public health surveillance and research programs; local, state, and federal government agencies; pharmaceutical research divisions; university research programs; and consulting firms. Students learn to assist in selecting research design appropriate for the goals of the research, estimate sample size requirements, establish and maintain databases, select and conduct the appropriate statistical analysis, and communicate the results of the analysis orally and in writing fields of public health. Coursework concentrates on developing these statistical skills through the use of actual data sets and computerized statistical software packages. Program Competencies Incorporate knowledge of the core areas of biostatistics, epidemiology, environmental health, health systems management, and the behavioral, social, and cultural aspects of health in addressing and solving problems. Select and conduct appropriate statistical procedures for evaluation of public health intervention and surveillance programs. Contribute to the design of public health programs by estimating the required sample size and power for program monitoring. Incorporate knowledge of databases and information systems in data collection and study management of public health intervention and surveillance programs. Interpret and effectively communicate statistical analysis results orally and in writing to public health investigators, collaborators, and members of general community.
