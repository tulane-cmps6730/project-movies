Bioinnovation, PhD Overview Requirements Graduate education in the sciences and engineering rarely offers the training and experiences that fully prepare graduates to enter directly into non-academic research and leadership positions. The Interdisciplinary PhD Program in Bioinnovation at Tulane University challenges this paradigm by cultivating in its students the ability to develop clinically-relevant biomedical technologies that have the potential to evolve into marketable products. Participating fellows benefit from and expand upon an environment of translational research at Tulane that spans the School of Science & Engineering (SSE), School of Medicine (SOM) and School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine (SPHTM). Simultaneous collaborations with the Business and Law Schools, industry partners and the FDA provide fellows with a strong foundation in entrepreneurship and regulation. This program was initiated in 2012 by an NSF Integrative Graduate Education and Research Traineeship (IGERT) award. Training within this program emphasizes bioinnovation, which we define as the development and progression to the marketplace of clinically relevant biomedical technologies and devices.
