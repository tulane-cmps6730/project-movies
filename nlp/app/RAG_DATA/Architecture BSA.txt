Architecture, BSA Overview Requirements The Bachelor of Science in Architecture (BSA) degree is a 4-year-long undergraduate course of study.  This program offers an integrated curriculum in the liberal arts and architecture designed to promote an understanding of design as a cultural expression while providing a strong preparation for graduate professional study in architecture or an array of other potential career paths. The BSA is a pre-professional degree in architecture that allows flexibility in the potential for double majoring and opportunities to join the architecture program after the freshman year. Graduates of this program are prepared to work in architectural or related offices and those who wish to become licensed architects would typically pursue a 2-year course of graduate study to attain an accredited professional degree in architecture.  Many graduates of this program will choose work or graduate education in a wide variety of areas including law, business, real estate, preservation, planning, and landscape architecture.

Notes on School of Architecture Curriculum: Students are strongly encouraged to reinforce and expand their skills and knowledge through professional internship experiences. These experiences are recognized in the form of academic credits. Undergraduate students may earn up to a total of six credit hours for internship over the course of their degree. See Internship for Academic Credit for details. Notes on Newcomb Tulane College Core Curriculum: University core & elective courses, with the exception of TIDES and English Composition, may be completed at any time during the student’s curriculum. To satisfy the Tier 2 Writing Intensive NTC Core Requirement students must take at least one Tier 2 designated course prior to beginning the of fourth year of study. Questions regarding these requirements sould be directed to your NTC Academic Advisor.
